  <h1>David Watson david@davidwatson.org</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>I help teams design, develop, and deploy commercial software. That software has spanned proprietary and open source approaches to content management systems, data center automation, enterprise software, and systems management. </p>
<p>My teams have shipped products by starting with a process of defining, prototyping, and iterating followed by reflecting, automating, and evolving. I enjoy working with small teams on emergent technology stacks that cannot be fully understood without a multidisciplinary, sensemaking approach.</p>
<p>When I'm not working, I like to I like to be active, outside, with my dog. In 2021, I finished two 5Ks, one 10K, and a half-marathon - the latter of which I medaled in my age group. I'm a competive person.</p>
