Welcome back for another deep dive. This time, um, we're doing things a little differently. We're focusing on just one source, David Watson's resume.

A resume? Really?

Yeah. Yeah, you heard that right. But trust me, this isn't your typical resume,

right? From the start, you see this unique blend of computer science and music education. And it really piqued my interest because it's like he sees this deeper connection between these two seemingly different fields, you know?

Okay, let's pack this a little bit. We see this fascination with both logic and creativity pretty early on. He's winning computer science awards while simultaneously he's immersed in music. Like he's setting the stage for something bigger.

And if we look closely, we see this pattern throughout his career. Drawn to companies like Cobine and Maya Design, both known for their collaborative environments. He's not just looking for a job. He's seeking a certain way of working. You know what I mean?

And here's where he gets really interesting, right? You notice he uses the word combined in his summary. And later mentions bridging this biccameal chasm in his book idea section. I'm sensing a connection. Maybe

you're picking up on something there. Kobind itself implies a bringing together a synthesis of different elements which resonates with his book idea which aims to bridge the gap between like seemingly disperate fields.

So Kobind is more than just a company name for David. It's a philosophy, a way of approaching the world.

Yeah. It's like a lens through which he views his work and even life itself.

So Let's shift gears a little bit and talk about how this cobbine philosophy shows up in his actual work, particularly in software development, because you see this emphasis on collaboration, shared learning, and even uses terms like improvise and orchestrate like a studio musician. He even mentions pizza teams to describe those efficient collaborative groups. What's that about? What insight does that give us about his leadership style?

It's more than just a quirky detail. It reveals a leader who values that close-knit collaboration and open communication. You know, it's like a flat hierarchy where everybody can contribute. It's a leadership style that really emphasizes agility and responsiveness, much like a musical ensemble working together to create harmony.

It makes me wonder if he consciously applies musical principles to his work in tech. You know, does he see code as a kind of composition with its own rhythm and structure? Does he approach problem solving with a musician's sense of improvisation and experimentation?

That's fascinating. While the resume doesn't explicitly state that, it didn't surprise me. Think about it. Both music and software development, they both require a deep understanding of patterns and structure and the ability to create something that's cohesive and functional from individual elements.

So, it's like he's conducting an orchestra of code, bringing together different instruments or in this case different technologies to create a symphony of software. But let's move beyond these metaphors for a second and dive into the specifics of his technical journey.

Okay. His career path is quite interesting. It spans both large corporations like Caterpillar and smaller, more agile startups like Rent Jungle.

Yeah. And this range exposes him to a variety of technologies and challenges. For example, at Caterpillar, he was optimizing code for specific hardware, right, which required a deep understanding of those low-level programming concepts.

And then at Rent Jungle, he's utilizing tools like Scrapey and Tour for data collection, demonstrating his comfort with web scraping techniques.

And we can't forget that at Wellspring Worldwide, he led a team that transitioned a million lines of code from this legacy data center to a cloud-based environment, implementing modern practices like CI/CD, DevOps, and SR principles.

It's a major accomplishment.

It really does seem like he thrives in those environments where innovation and rapid adaptation are key.

But do you think there's a risk that such a varied background could actually work against him? Like could it lead to a lack of focus or depth in a specific area?

That's a valid concern. But what I see here is not a scattered approach, but rather a strategic accumulation. diverse experiences. David is consistently seeking opportunities to expand his skill set and tackle new challenges.

So you see his diverse background is an asset, not a liability. He's basically building a toolbox filled with a wide range of skills, making him a more versatile technologist.

Exactly. And this versatility becomes even more apparent when you look at his role as IT compliance officer at Wellbridge Health. This position requires a different skill set altogether, focusing more on security and regulations and navigating that complex landscape of healthcare data.

It seems to highlight his ability to bridge technical and non-technical domains which we've already seen in his affinity for bringing different fields together. Yeah. Like he's constantly seeking connections, ways to synthesize different areas of knowledge.

And this, I believe, is a key takeaway from David's career. He's not simply a programmer or a technologist. He's a connector, a bridgeuer, someone who thrives at the intersection of different disciplines.

Not just collecting jobs, but curating experiences. allow him to grow and explore new territories.

Precisely. And this intentional approach is something I think our listeners can relate to and maybe even apply to their own career paths.

So, we've uncovered how David's early interest in both logic and creativity has kind of manifested throughout his career, right? We've explored how his combine philosophy translates into a leadership style that values collaboration and agility. And we've seen his journey through this diverse range of technical challenges, revealing his thirst for new knowledge. But there's another layer to this story, one that goes beyond the world of code and into the realm of ideas.

And that's where his potential book comes in. This ambitious project with its intriguing title and complex concepts promises to be a fascinating exploration of the connections between ancient wisdom, modern technology, and human creativity. You know, it's interesting how his book idea takes center stage on his resume. Like, it's not just an afterthought. It's right up front, signaling it's important to him.

Almost like a mission statement, kind of, you know, a declaration of goals. But honestly, that title is a little intimidating. Synthesizing an arc from the trivium to the quadriium by bridging the bicamal chasm from GPT to MIDI. What is that all about?

Well, let's break it down a little. The trivia and quadrum are um classical education frameworks. They cover seven liberal arts. Grammar, logic, and rhetoric. That's the triv. And then arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy. That's the quadriium.

Okay. So, ancient ways of understanding the world. through language reasoning and science. But how's that connect to GPT like a language model and MIDI a music standard? Those seem pretty modern.

That's where this bicamal chasm comes in. It refers to the perceived divide between the left and right hemispheres of the brain often linked to logic and creativity. Dave seems to suggest these old disciplines like from the trivium and quadriium can help bridge that divide using tech like GPT and MIDI to explore it.

So he's not seeing separate things but a way to bring logic and creativity together, ancient wisdom and modern tech into one,

right? It's a synthesis, a way to integrate what seem like opposite forces.

But has he actually done this like practically

bridge these divides in his work?

Remember his time at Wellbridge Health, leading that interdisciplinary design team, collaborating with Maya Design to deliver that minimum viable product that shows he can bring diverse expertise together, mixing technology with user- centered design. It's bridging the bicameal chasm in a real project. That's a great point. So, it's not just theory for him. It's something he's applying, and it makes his book even more intriguing. Will he give concrete examples of using these old ideas for modern problems with technology as the link?

I'd imagine so. His background in music and computer science makes him uniquely suited to explore way. Maybe he'll look at how musical ideas inform software, how algorithms make art, or even how AI changes how we understand the human mind.

It's a big undertaking, but given what we've seen, I think he could pull it off. It makes me think about the personal interests on his resume, reading, writing, running. Do those things actually feed into his creativity, even if they seem unrelated?

Absolutely. We often don't realize how valuable diverse interests are. Running, for example, can be meditative, helping you think deeply and solve problems. Reading exposes you to new ideas. These things might be giving him fuel for his creativity and space to process and connect things.

It's a good reminder for all of us to explore those different interest. even if they don't seem tied to our work. You never know what'll spark an idea or how experiences might connect to give a bigger picture.

And speaking of connecting, his resume itself is like that. It's not just a job list. It's a story emphasizing what runs through all his experiences leading to this book.

So a resume can be more than just facts. It can be a reflection of who we are, what we want, and how we see things.

And in David's case, it's an invitation to join him on this intellectual journey. He's bridging ancient wisdom with modern tech. And imately pushing the limits of what we think is possible.

As we near the end of looking at David's resume, it's amazing how much we learned from it. We saw his co-bion philosophy, his passion for bridging divides, and his ambition to synthesize seemingly different things.

But what's really incredible is that it's not just about a lot of experience. It's how deeply he thinks. He's not just gaining skills. He's developing a unique worldview, valuing connection, creativity, and constant learning.

And our listener might be thinking, So what? What can I do with this?

Well, think about your own resume. Could it tell a better story about you, highlighting what connects your experiences and goals? What kind of work do you look for? Are you trying to bridge gaps, connect things, and bring knowledge from different areas together?

And don't forget the importance of those personal interests. Give yourself the space to make those surprising connections. That's where true breakthroughs happen.

David's resume shows what we can achieve with a lifelong learning mindset. Embrace those different interests and try to bridge those gaps between seemingly separate fields.

So, keep exploring, keep making connections, and keep pushing those boundaries. You might be the next David Watson, waiting to share your unique view with the world. As we wrap up this deep dive, I keep thinking about David's potential book and, you know, how it could impact the whole conversation we're having about technology, AI especially.

Yeah, it's a good point. AI is changing so fast and there are all these discussions about ethics and industries being disrupted. Even like AI's role in shaping human 's future. David brings a different view to that, you know, a valuable one.

I'm really stuck on this bicameal chasm thing. Do you think his book can help us move past this idea of AI being either like our savior or a huge threat? Because it feels like that's the debate a lot of times.

I think that's exactly his goal. He's connecting ancient wisdom with this modern technology, suggesting we don't have to pick sides, logic or our creativity, the power of AI or human values. It's more like how to combine them.

It's like he's saying, "Hey, AI isn't something to be scared of or to worship blindly. It's a tool, a powerful one for sure,

but it could be used in different ways depending on who's controlling it and what their values are.

And maybe by looking at AI through the lens of these ancient principles, the trivium and quadrivium, we can approach it with more, I don't know, wisdom, more humility,

and really grasp how it might change society.

So his book could be this call for a more balanced discussion about AI, one that cuts through the hype and the fear and focuses on how we can use it to boost human creativity. solve tough problems and yeah create a better future.

It's a big ambition, but looking at what David's done, I think it's possible and I think HS the kind of person who can lead that kind of discussion. He has the technical knowledge, the human values, and that passion for connecting things that seem totally different.
