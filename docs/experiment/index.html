<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>All right, ready for another deep dive? Today we're looking into the career of David Watson.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Oh, this should be good.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah, his resume. It's uh Well, first thing, the guy's got computer science and music education. That's not your typical combination.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Definitely not. Color me intrigued. How does that even, you know, how does that play into a tech career?
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>That is the million-dollar question. What can we learn from a career path like that? How did he, you know, take those two things and find success? And maybe, just maybe, we'll get some inspiration. for ourselves along the way. Kind of a peak behind the curtain, right?
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>I'm all for that. Let's see what we've got. Okay, so he calls himself a sagacious software engineer. Love that, by the way. And then lists AI, API, HCI, HPC.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Okay, slow down. Acronyms galore. I'm sure most of our listeners are following, but just in case, could you, you know, break those down real quick?
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Of course. So, artificial intelligence, application programming interfaces, human computer interaction, and high performance computing. But here's the thing. It's not just a bunch of trendy terms. This points to uh well, a much bigger trend. We're seeing the rise of the quote T-shaped professional.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>T-shaped. What's that? Someone with like really long arms.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Uh-huh. No. No. Think of the letter T. Yeah. So, that vertical line, that's deep expertise in one specific area. But the horizontal line just as important. That represents like a wider understanding across other fields.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Gotcha. I see where you're going with this.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Yeah. So, you see this with David Watson. He's got his deep dive right? AI, HBC, but he's also connecting to user experience with HCI and how systems talk to each other with APIs.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>So, not just a coder in a basement, he can actually work with well other humans.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>You got it. And that's, you know, that's becoming more and more valuable. Think about it. Tech keeps getting more complex. So, you need people who can connect the dots, see the big picture.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Makes sense. All right, let's get into the details of the actual work. At Wyvern, he deprecated legacy code, reduced complexity by 25%. Now, I'm no coder, but even I know legacy code can be a nightmare.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Huge win right there. It's uh legacy code. It's often clunky, inefficient, hard to maintain. So, what he did wasn't just cleanup. It was making the system actually better, perform better, easier to work with. It shows well serious problem solving skills,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>right? Like taking an old rusty car and making it per like new. But then he goes and prototypes a personal knowledge management system using GPT and requests. Now, this is where it gets really interesting for me. Talk about AI crawling the web. It's like sci-fi stuff.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>It does sound futuristic, doesn't it? But what's so smart here, he's taking this cutting edge tech and he's tackling a very human problem. How do we organize? How do we find the information we need? And not just GPT alone, combining it with requests, which lets you, you know, pull info from the web to build this custom knowledge base.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Hold on. So, he's making his own like personalized Google, but powered by AI.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>You could say that. Really innovative. Shows he's willing to experiment to find creative solutions using whatever's out there.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Okay. Color me impressed. Then at Caterpillar, he builds a a ZCU 104 port for their terrain visualization code and gets a 20 40% performance boost. I have no clue what a ZCU 104 is, but that sounds significant.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>It is. So, think of it this way. Caterpillar, they use advanced software for their heavy machinery, right? Terrain visualization.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>The ZCU 104, that's a powerful piece of hardware meant for embedded systems like the ones in their equipment. He basically tuned their code to make the most of that hardware. Hence the performance jump.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Ah I see. So not just code but understanding the hardware too.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Exactly. Bridging that gap between software and hardware. As tech keeps evolving we need more people who get how those two worlds work together.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Got it. Okay. So coding wizardry down pat. But these then he's working with it execs at Caterpillar on cloudnative storage strategies. So he's fluent in like code and D business language.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Crucial skill. You can be the best coder but if you can't explain it to the people making decisions your impact is limited. He can navigate both worlds, tech and business. That shows real versatility, understanding the big picture, you know,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>it's like he's got a secret decoder ring.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>But here's what really grabbed me. At Rent Jungle, he leads weekly retros to improve team communication. And then building a scrapey crawler, he makes sure it operates ethically. That's well, that's not something you see every day,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>right? And it's something we need to see more of. Honestly, tech skills, they're essential, but they're not the whole story. Being able to communicate, to collaborate, and to think about the ethics of what you're building. Those are the things that set you apart in the long run.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>It's like he's a tech humanist, a rare breed indeed. And on top of all that, he co-ounds a company, Coobbind, and builds DIY Linux tools. Does this guy ever sleep?
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>It speaks volumes about his drives, his love for learning. Co-founding a company, that's a whole other set of skills. Vision, leadership, business savvy, and those DIY Linux tools, that's passion, tinkering, wanting to understand how things work at their core.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>So, we've got this amazing mix tech expertise, communication, ethical awareness, entrepreneurial spirits, a one-man tech army,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>and it all started with a computer science and music education combo.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>I'm curious, what's jumping out at you so far? It's how he brings those deep tech skills together with that understanding of the human side, you know, like he sees the bigger picture, how tech fits into our lives, not just the code itself. That's well, that's something we could all learn from, I think.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>For sure. It makes Wonder does the music background play a role there? Maybe it's about like finding harmony not just a music but how technology and people interact.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>That's interesting. Music it like about communication emotions. Maybe that translates to how he approaches tech. It's not just functional. There's a well a human element there.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah. Like composing a symphony but with technology making sure all the pieces work together but with people in mind not just the machines.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>I like that analogy. And speaking of Well, this also highlights another takeaway.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Continuous learning. He didn't just stop with his degrees. He's got, look at this, continuing education at MIT, internet application programming, relational database management systems.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah, I noticed that. Always pushing himself, adding to his skill set. First computer science, then music, technical writing. It's like he collects skills the way some people collect, I don't know, stamps.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>And in this day and age, that's so important. Tech changes so fast. You got to adapt, learn new things, or you get left behind. It's a constant evolution.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Totally. You can't just sit back and say, Hey, I'm done learning.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Mhm.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Especially in tech. Got to be curious. Always looking for what's next.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>And it's not just about knowing stuff. It's about using it, trying things out, pushing the limits. You see that with his company, Cobbind, and those DIY Linux tools. Those weren't just hobbies. They were chances to learn by doing, you know.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Yeah. He's got that, what's the word? That hunger for a challenge, building things, figuring stuff out. That DIY spirit. That's something I admire, honestly.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Valuable trait, especially if you're starting a business. Resort. ful not afraid to experiment even if it means failing sometimes and those early days tinkering with tools that probably gave him like a deeper understanding of how things work under the hood which would help to the AI the HBC stuff later on
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>right makes sense okay so we've got the skills the learning the entrepreneurial side what about leadership he led those weekly retros at Rent Jungle and managed software teams at Wallpring
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>that's interesting he doesn't shy away from leading shows he's not just a act, but can bring people together, get them moving towards a goal. Essential skill no matter what you're doing.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>And at Wellbridge Health, he was a VP of product development and the IT compliance officer. Talk about multitasking.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Shows he can handle complex projects. Juggle responsibilities, make the tough calls, willing to, you know, step outside his comfort zone, take on new roles.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>So, we've seen this career unfold. The technical brilliance, that human- centered approach, the drive to build things, the leadership, it's almost well a bit overwhelming how much She's done.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>I know, right? But don't think of it as like intimidating. Think of it as inspiring. It shows that careers don't have to be a straight line. It's okay to explore, to try different things,
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>and having a unique mix of skills that can be your superpower, you know.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Yeah. It's not just what you do, it's how you do it. He approaches tech with curiosity, empathy, that desire to learn and grow. Those are things we can all work on no matter what our job is.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Absolutely. So, here's a question for you, our listener.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>If you could ask David Watson one question about his career or about the future of tech, what would it be?
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>Ooh, that's a good one. What would I ask? Hm. You know, I keep coming back to this empathy thing. We've talked about how human- centered his approach is, but with AI getting well as so powerful, how do we make sure it stays, you know, beneficial that it helps us, not the other way around.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>That's the big question, isn't it? It's not enough for AI to be smart, efficient, and have to align with, well, us, our values, our needs. It has to make our lives better, not just, you know, different Exactly. And I think looking at David Watson's career, maybe there's a clue there. That blend of technical, but also that human side. He seems to like bridge that gap between the cold logic of machines and well, what it means to be human.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>He's almost like a translator, right? Helping us understand AI and making sure AI understands us. Yeah. Maybe that's the key going forward. Finding more people who can speak both those languages.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>So, not just coding skills, but those softer skills, empathy, communication, thinking about the ethics of it all. Exactly. As AI gets more complex, those are the skills that will matter even more. We need people who can design AI systems that are smart, sure, but also ethical, responsible, aligned with, well, with humanity.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>You know, throughout this whole deep dive, what strikes me about him is that sense of purpose. It's not just building cool tech for the sake of it. It's using tech to solve real problems, to make things better.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>And that's what makes a career more than just a job, right? Something I'm sure a lot of our listeners can relate to. You don't have to be a tech is to make a difference. It's about finding that place where your passions, your skills, and what the world needs all come together.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva: </span>And maybe that's the big lesson from David Watson. It's not about following a set path. It's making your own WN path. Being open to new things and knowing that human ingenuity, that's what shapes the future of tech.
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski: </span>Well said. So, to wrap things up, we leave you with this. What impact do you want to make? What unique mix of skills and experiences do you bring? And how will you use those to create A future where tech and humanity, they thrive together.
