<h1>All Animals are Conscious!</h1>
<p>My love of fate was found in the book(s) I've worked on for the last
five years. About two years ago, I realized that writing is straightforward but publishing is pointless.

<h3>The Rub: Animal Intelligence vs Actual Intelligence</h3>
</p>
<p>
The realizations didn't stop there. When <a href="https://www.anilseth.com">Anil Seth</a> first saw consciousness as transient hallucination,
I believed him.

The key to me, is that Seth's insight  applies not just to humans but animals as well.
</p>
<p>

<h3>The Truth: Intelligence is a thin slice of Consciousness.</h3>

<p>Hence, we needed a consciousness
quotient (CQ).</p>

<p>IQ is lossy. The untold damage done by the mere existence of IQ
is immeasurable.</p>
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, we got that answer over a decade ago from  a researcher named Ovidiu Brazdau, a Romanian who <a href="https://scholar.google.ro/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=p0KMp6IAAAAJ&citation_for_view=p0KMp6IAAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C">wrote a paper</a>, then <a href="https://www.consciousness-quotient.com">founded an institute.</a>

    <p>These beautiful dogs dynamic situational awareness make sense of complex context, conditions, and environment at once!
<p>Consciousness is complex.We tap screens to find facts lost and consensus unfound. Canine gazes mask consensus.
<p>Canines mix crazy fast concurrent hallucinations into consciousness just like we do!</h2>
<p>Does it really matter whether dogs faces evoke Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell, or Grandma's white-bearded stoic senex?
<p>Is there a difference between canine consciousness and animal intelligence?
<p>Dogs know naturally what we think or feel liminally at the hazy edges of consciousness.</p>
