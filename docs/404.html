    <h1>Animal Intelligence beats AI and Human Intellect!</h1>
    <img src="/images/vizslas.jpg">
    <p>The dogs' gaze gives it away in consensus or collective intelligence. They know they're smart.</p>
    <p>We tap screens to find facts where few are found.</p>
<p>    Dogs' faces mask mask mirror worlds while bookface verbal violence kills softly with insults.</p>
   <p>Dogs know naturally what few humans can feel.</p>
   <!-- The lyric is not "killing me sofly with insults". -->
    <!-- The lyric was, "killing me softly with his song". -->
    <!-- May not matter. Whether you take Seal's words for it, Sting's words for it, or Robert Plant's. -->
    <!-- from Led Zeppelin,  the song remains the same.--> 
    <!-- realize birds are there when birds are mostly invisible to us. Why? Because dog eye-nose-ear beat sensor triangulation all day, every day, for the foreseeable future..</p> -->
