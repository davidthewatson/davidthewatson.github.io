Welcome back everyone. Ready for another deep dive?

Always. What are we diving into today?

Well, today we're switching things up a bit.

Oo, I like the sound of that.

We're going to explore someone's career.

Okay.

Using their resume.

Interesting. Whose resume are we dissecting?

A guy named David Watson.

David Watson. Okay. I'm intrigued.

And I know what you're thinking. Résumés?

Yeah, they can be kind of dry.

Exactly. But trust me on this one. There's some real gold hidden in here.

Okay, you've got my attention.

Just to give you a taste.

Yeah.

This guy won a computer science award before he even went to music school.

Wow. Okay, that's pretty interesting.

I know, right? And then we're talking SMS campaigns for the Pittsburgh Steelers.

No way.

Oh, yeah. And hold on to your hats because there's even underwater robots in the mix.

Underwater robots. Seriously.

Seriously, this resume is like a treasure map.

Okay, I'm hooked. Let's unpack this thing.

All right, let's start at the beginning with that computer science award before music school.

Yeah. What's the story there? Right. Was he just super indecisive? Or

or maybe he's just someone who loves both the analytical and the creative.

I mean, that's kind of amazing, right? To be able to jump between those two worlds like that.

It definitely suggests a certain curiosity

and a willingness to defy expectations.

Totally. Have you ever felt that pull in opposite directions?

Oh, absolutely. And I think a lot of people can relate to that.

It's like this inner struggle between following your head and following your heart.

Exactly. And in David's case, seems like he found a way to embrace both.

You know, you're right.

And as we go through his resume, we see that duality pop up again and again.

Oh, really? Where do you see that?

Well, look at his early jobs in software development. Okay.

He's not just sticking to one industry or one technology.

He's all over the place.

He's jumping from project to project, picking up new skills, always pushing himself.

Sounds like he was building a really diverse skill set early on.

Absolutely. And that kind of adaptability is so valuable in today's world.

No doubt. What kind of projects was he working on back then?

Well, for example, at Rent Jungle, he was building web crawlers using tools like Scrapey and Django.

So, like programs that automatically gather information from websites.

Exactly. Which is actually pretty complex stuff.

Yeah. It involves understanding how websites are structured, how to extract data, and how to deal with all the messy inconsistencies you find on the web.

Right. And then at Wbridge Health, he led the development of a whole browserbased application.

Oh, interesting. What was that for

well they were trying to move away from their reliance on the app store.

So basically creating web app that could function like a native app.

Exactly. And this was back when everyone was still obsessed with mobile apps.

So he was kind of ahead of the curve there.

Definitely. And those experiences really highlight his entrepreneurial side.

It's not just about coding. It's about seeing a problem and building a solution.

Exactly. He's a builder, a problem solver, a creator.

I like it. It's giving me Silicon Valley vibes.

Right. And then things take a turn. for the well the industrial

industrial what do you mean

he lands a consulting gig at Caterpillar

Caterpillar like the construction equipment company

the one and only

okay this I got to hear

but this wasn't your typical software development gig

oh what was it then

he was optimizing code

okay

for a very specific hardware platform the XYlink ZCU 104

zlink CCU 104

yeah you familiar with that one

rings a bell that's a pretty powerful piece of hardware, isn't it?

Oh, yeah. For those who might not know, we're talking about something called an FPGA,

a field programmable gate array.

Exactly. And these things are like blank slates for building circuits.

So, you can program them to do all sorts of specialized tasks

and do them extremely efficiently,

which is crucial in industrial settings,

right? Think real-time processing, low power consumption, all that good stuff.

So, he had to really get down into the nitty-gritty of how this hardware worked.

Absolutely. And you know what? He nailed it.

He did.

Oh, yeah. Achieve D some serious time optimizations

which translate to huge cost savings for a company like Caterpillar.

Right. So now we've got this picture of David as someone who can bridge the gap between software and hardware.

It's like he's fluent in both languages.

Totally. And then things get kind of mysterious.

Mysterious. How so?

His next role is at Carnegie Melon University's Emerging Technology Center.

Okay. Sounds impressive.

But the details of his work are redacted.

Redacted. like top secret stuff

could be. All we know is that it involved AI, human computer interaction, and high performance computing.

Wow, that's a pretty intriguing combination,

right? It's like we've stumbled upon a hidden chapter in his story,

and we're left to wonder what secrets it holds.

Exactly. But even without knowing the specifics, we can see that David is drawn to the cutting edge.

He's not afraid to push the boundaries.

And that's where things get really, really interesting.

Okay, I'm on the edge of my seat. What happens next?

Well, you'll have to wait for part two to find out. out.

H the suspense.

So, what do you think? Was he working on some kind of secret project? Something they couldn't put on his resume.

Maybe. Who knows? It does make you wonder, doesn't it?

Oh, for sure. I mean, we're talking AI, human computer interaction, high performance computing. That's like the trifecta of cutting edge tech,

you know?

Yeah. It's like he was working on the future

and we're only getting these little glimpses.

Exactly. And it's those glimpses that make it so fascinating. like pieces of a puzzle trying to figure out the bigger picture,

right? And remember, even before this Carnegie Melon gig, there were hints that he was interested in this kind of stuff.

Oh, yeah. What do you mean?

Well, think back to his time at Rent Jungle. He was already using those innovative teamwork techniques,

affinity diagrams, pair programming, all that.

Yep. And those aren't just about writing code faster, you know? It's about understanding how humans interact with technology

and how to optimize those interactions for better results,

which is super relevant to HCI. Right.

Totally. So even back then he was thinking about the human element, not just the tech itself.

It's like he had this instinct to bring people together to collaborate and build something amazing.

Exactly. And I think that instinct is what's driven him throughout his career.

So we have this image of David as a builder, a leader, someone who can rally people around a common goal.

But then there's this other side to him, the side that's drawn to the unknown, the cutting edge, always pushing the bound. And I think that's what makes him so unique. You know, he's not afraid to experiment, try new things, even if it means stepping outside his comfort zone.

It's like he's got this insatiable curiosity, a thirst for knowledge that just can't be quenched. What do you think drives someone like that? What kind of personality is drawn to those challenges?

That's a great question. I think it's a combination of things. You've got to have a certain level of intelligence, obviously, but also a lot of courage and a willingness to fail because Not every experiment is going to be a success. Right.

Right. And it's those failures that often teach us the most valuable lessons.

Exactly. So maybe it's the learning process itself that drives him. The joy of discovery, the thrill of pushing the boundaries and seeing what's possible.

I like that. It's not about the destination, it's about the journey.

Totally. And I think that's something we can all learn from.

For sure. So where do you think this journey takes him next after this mysterious role at Carnegie Melon? What kind of project do you imagine him tackling?

Well, given in his background and his clear passion for pushing the limits. I wouldn't be surprised if he went even deeper into AI.

Oh, yeah. Like what specifically?

Maybe something involving artificial general intelligence. AGI, you know, AI that can learn and solve problems like a human. Or maybe even surpass human capabilities.

Whoa. Now that's getting into some really futuristic territory.

I know, right? But think about it. He's already got the experience in AI, HCI, and high performance computing. Those are all essential ingredients for developing AGI and it aligns perfectly with his desire to push the boundaries.

I can definitely see that. It's a challenge worthy of his talents.

Totally. But, you know, there's another possibility that I find even more intriguing.

Okay, I'm all ears.

What if he's working on something that combines his technical expertise with his passion for human connection? Something that uses AI to enhance our relationships, our communities, our ability to communicate and understand each other. Oh wow, that's a really beautiful thought. Using AI to make the world a more connected and compassionate place. It's almost like a counternarrative to all the dystopian fears we hear about AI taking over the world.

Exactly. And I think David with his unique skill set and his obvious empathy for others would be the perfect person to lead that kind of initiative.

I completely agree. It would be a project that truly makes a difference in the world.

And wouldn't that be amazing to witness the power of technology being used to bring people together? instead of tearing us apart.

It gives me hope for the future. That's for sure.

But you know, there's one other detail on his resume that we haven't talked about yet.

Oh, you mean the passion section.

Exactly. Reading, writing, running. Those aren't just hobbies, are they? They tell us something about who he is, what motivates him. What do you make of those?

Yeah. They're like little clues to his inner world, you know? Totally. And they're not just your typical passive hobbies either,

right? Like he specifically mentions books like Crystal Clear about effective communication

and and flow which is all about finding that state of deep engagement.

Not exactly light beach reads.

Definitely not. These are books that make you think that challenge your assumptions.

It suggests that he's not just interested in technology for technologies sake.

Right. He wants to understand the human impact.

How it can be used to improve our lives, our work, our relationships.

Exactly. And then there's running.

Ah, yes. The classic endurance sport.

Which tells me he's got discipline, perseverance,

the ability to push through challenges

and that aligns perfectly with what we've seen in his career, right?

Absolutely. He doesn't shy away from hard work.

He embraces it,

sees it as an opportunity to grow and learn.

So maybe these passions aren't just side interests, you know?

Maybe they're actually fundamental to who he is.

Like they're woven into the fabric of his being.

I think you're right.

It's like all these pieces of the puzzle, his technical skills, his leadership qualities, his intellectual curiosity, and these deeply personal passions, they all fit together to create this incredibly well-rounded individual.

It's really inspiring, isn't it?

It is. It reminds us that a resume is more than just a list of jobs and accomplishments.

It's a reflection of someone's values, their aspirations,

and it can give us a glimpse into the kind of future they're striving to create,

which in David's case seems to be a future full of possibility and innovation, and a deep understanding of what it means to be human.

And that's what makes this deep dive so fascinating.

It's not just about analyzing a resume.

It's about uncovering a story,

a story of passion, purpose, purpose and the relentless pursuit of something bigger than oneself.

And so to all our listeners out there, we're leaving you with this final thoughtprovoking question. Based on what we've learned about David Watson, what kind of project do you think he'd be most excited to tackle next? What problem would he be most passionate about solving?
