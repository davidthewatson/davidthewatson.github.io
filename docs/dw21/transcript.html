  <p>All right. So, today we're diving into something a little different. Um, instead of a company or a specific technology, we're taking a look at a person's career and it's all based on just one document, a resume.</p>
<p>You know, it's funny. People think resumes are just like a boring list of jobs.</p>
<p>Right. Right. Like a formality.</p>
<p>Yeah. Just facts and dates. But</p>
<p>but but there's a story there.</p>
<p>It's like a puzzle.</p>
<p>Exactly. And today's puzzle is the career of uh David Watson. Now, I got to say just glancing at this resume.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>This guy's got an interesting background.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah.</p>
<p>Yeah. He's got this mix of computer science and music. Look at this. Even before music school, he won a computer science award.</p>
<p>Huh. Now, that's interesting. You know, those kinds of unexpected combinations can lead to some really creative thinking.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And I'm already seeing signs of that just in the variety of companies and roles he's had. I mean, we're talking startups like Cobb to huge corporations like Caterpillar. He's even spent time at Carnegie Melon University.</p>
<p>Wow. Wow, talk about range. That kind of flexibility is gold in the tech world,</p>
<p>right? And the industries are all over the map, too. Healthcare, robotics, real estate. I'm sensing a theme of not being afraid to jump into new things.</p>
<p>Definitely. Now, let's see. What about the technical side? What kind of skills are we seeing here?</p>
<p>Oh, his technical chops are definitely strong. Python, C++, mine, JavaScript, these are popping up all over his resume. But it's the specific projects he highlights that are really eye-catching.</p>
<p>Oh, I love those. details. Those really bring a resume to life.</p>
<p>Totally. Like at Wyvern, he mentions deprecating legacy code, which resulted in a 25% reduction in complexity.</p>
<p>Ooh, legacy code. That can be a real beast,</p>
<p>right? Imagine the patience you'd need for that.</p>
<p>Not to mention the skill to achieve a reduction like that. That's impressive</p>
<p>for sure. Okay. Then there's this one that just it really sparked my curiosity. Prototyped a personal knowledge management concept using GPT and requests.</p>
<p>GPT, huh? He's diving. into AI territory,</p>
<p>right? It sounds kind of futuristic. What exactly is GPT and why would you use it for something like that?</p>
<p>Well, GPT is a type of AI, a language model. It's trained on tons and tons of text, so it can understand and even generate humanlike text.</p>
<p>Okay, so it's like super smart autocomplete</p>
<p>kind of, but more than that, it can summarize information, translate languages, and in David's case, it seems he was exploring how to use it to organize personal information.</p>
<p>That's Interesting. Like a superpowered personal assistant almost,</p>
<p>right? It shows he's thinking about how to apply AI to real world problems.</p>
<p>Okay, there's one more project I got to mention because it sounds like something out of a spy movie. Built a scrapey crawler over tour to gather real estate data without being detected.</p>
<p>Whoa. A little web scraping action.</p>
<p>Yeah. So, first of all, what's a web crawler?</p>
<p>Imagine a little robot that browses the internet for you, automatically going to websites and collecting information.</p>
<p>Okay. And tour. That rings a bell, but tour is like a secret network that makes it really hard to track where your internet traffic's coming from.</p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p>So, basically, David needed to gather this real estate data without getting caught or blocked.</p>
<p>That's pretty clever.</p>
<p>It is. And it shows he's comfortable working with tools that are a bit more, shall we say, under the radar.</p>
<p>Definitely resourceful. You know, these projects really showcase the creativity involved in software engineering. It's not just about coding. It's about finding solutions.</p>
<p>Totally. And what I like is that David doesn't just his skills, he gives us a glimpse into how he actually applied them to get results.</p>
<p>Right. And speaking of insights, there's one phrase in his summary that jumped out at me. Realizing empathy is common sense at the intersection of human computer sensemaking.</p>
<p>Wow. Empathy. You don't see that on a tech resume every day.</p>
<p>I know, right? It makes me think he really understands that technology isn't just about the tech itself. It's about the people using it.</p>
<p>For sure. That's userentric design. And it's becoming more and more crucial.</p>
<p>I wonder if his background in music has something to do with that. I mean, music is all about connecting with people on an emotional level.</p>
<p>You know, that's a really interesting point. It's possible that his musical training has given him a deeper understanding of the human experience, which then feeds into his approach to technology.</p>
<p>It's like all these different parts of his life are informing his work in these unique ways. And speaking of different parts, we got to talk about his commitment to learning. MIT, RDBMS, continuing education. This guy is always seeking out new knowledge.</p>
<p>That's so important in the tech world. Things change so fast. You got to constantly be learning and adapting. The fact that he's actively pursuing continuing education speaks volumes.</p>
<p>And you can see it in how his skill set has evolved from early web development to cloudnative stuff like Docker and Kubernetes. He's not afraid to embrace the new.</p>
<p>And that's what keeps you relevant in this field. You can't just stick with what you know.</p>
<p>Exactly. And it's not just about the technical side either, right? His resume also highlights his leadership and collaboration experience leading teams at Wellspring, improving communication at Rent Jungle through agile methods,</p>
<p>right? Because technical skills alone won't get you there. You got to be able to work effectively with others, communicate your ideas, and lead a team.</p>
<p>And he even gets specific with the agile techniques, mentioning affinity diagrams and pair work. It shows he's not just familiar with the concepts, but he's actually put them into practice.</p>
<p>That practical experience is invaluable. All right. So, we've got this picture of David as someone with strong technical chops, a knack for adaptability, and clear leadership qualities.</p>
<p>And this is just from the first page of his resume. I can't wait to dig into the rest.</p>
<p>Me, too. There's so much more to uncover.</p>
<p>Okay, so we're back and ready to go even deeper with David Watson's resume. You know, it's striking how much this one document can reveal. It's like a window into his thought process.</p>
<p>Yeah. It's not just about what he did, but how he did it. Like, look at his time at Applied Perception.</p>
<p>He talks about visualizing XML sonar data.</p>
<p>Okay, that sounds pretty technical.</p>
<p>It is. But then he adds, for UUV deployments, UUVs,</p>
<p>UUV,</p>
<p>unmanned underwater vehicles.</p>
<p>Oh, underwater robots. That's way cooler. Suddenly, it's not just lines of code. It's like a real world application,</p>
<p>right? And it reminds us that even the most technical work can have this like tangible impact.</p>
<p>Okay, speaking of real world impact, check this out. At Nomos, he worked on a Corvvisa FDA regulated product.</p>
<p>FDA, that's serious stuff.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, the FDA, Food and Drug Administration, they regulate medical devices. So, we know David was involved in something with high stakes,</p>
<p>right? People's health is on the line.</p>
<p>He even gives us these little hints about the scope. Team of 12 around two million lines of code on a Mac. That's a big project.</p>
<p>Wow. Two million lines of code. I can't even imagine. Okay, next up, Maya. Design. And get this. He says he demoed a gy lighting IoT Ziggb putt te and Five days.</p>
<p>Five days.</p>
<p>Five days.</p>
<p>That's incredible. He moves fast,</p>
<p>right? But also, I'm going to need a translation here. G I But IoT Ziggby.</p>
<p>So, think smartarthome. IoT is the internet of things. All those devices connected to the internet like your smart lights, thermostats, all that.</p>
<p>Okay. Right. Right.</p>
<p>And Ziggb is a type of wireless tech that a lot of those devices use to communicate. So, it seems like David whipped up a demo showcasing smart lighting tech for Philips executives.</p>
<p>Whoa. And he did all that in 5 days. That's some serious pressure.</p>
<p>Definitely. It shows he can think on his feet and deliver results under tight deadlines.</p>
<p>Totally. You know, seeing all this, it's clear that David has that entrepreneurial spirit. Remember Cobbind? He co-founded a startup focused on DIY Linux tools.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. And even got international recognition. That's not easy.</p>
<p>It's impressive. I mean, to take a technical skill and turn it into a business, that takes a lot of guts.</p>
<p>And creativity and problem solving, it all ties back to those qualities we keep seeing.</p>
<p>Absolutely. Okay, let's move on to Forever where he prototyped a full stack application on something called Proximox GitLab. And then get this, he ported the MVP from Python to Ruby on Rails.</p>
<p>Oo, a full stack port. That's no small feat,</p>
<p>right? So, first of all, full stack means he's working on both ends of the application. Yeah. What users see and the behindthe-scenes stuff.</p>
<p>Exactly. Both front end and back end and porting it to a completely different framework that takes serious technical understanding.</p>
<p>And he clearly nailed it because he mentions enabling the company to gain strong market traction after releasing the 1.0 ecommerce platform. His work directly led to their success.</p>
<p>That's what it's all about. It's not just about the code. It's about understanding how it fits into the bigger picture, how it drives business outcomes.</p>
<p>And speaking of business outcomes, we can't forget his time at Smash where he was writing conversational text systems, kind of like Twilio.</p>
<p>Oh, yeah. Like those chatbot things. I use those all the time.</p>
<p>Me, too. And check this out. He even supported large MS text campaigns for huge names like the Pittsburgh Steelers and Miller Kors.</p>
<p>Wow. So, we've all probably interacted with his work at some point. That's kind of cool to think about.</p>
<p>I know, right? It really hits home how much David's work has touched our daily lives. It's amazing how much we've learned just from this one resume.</p>
<p>And we're not even done yet. There's still more to uncover, especially those later experiences with cloud tech and leadership at Wellspring and Rent Jungle.</p>
<p>And we're back. It's time to wrap up our deep dive into David Watson's career and I'm really excited to see where this last part takes us.</p>
<p>Me, too. You know, we've seen him build up this incredible skill set, jump between industries, even start his own company.</p>
<p>Right. Right. He's definitely not afraid of a challenge.</p>
<p>Definitely not. And now we're getting to his time at Wellspring, which seems like a real turning point. He steps into a leadership role as software development manager.</p>
<p>Okay. So, now he's not just coding, he's managing teams, too.</p>
<p>Exactly. And not just any teams. He's leading two teams, Sophia and Flintbox through A major transition.</p>
<p>A transition, huh? What kind?</p>
<p>Imagine moving a million line of code data center to a cloud-based sauce environment.</p>
<p>Whoa, that sounds massive.</p>
<p>It is. It's like moving a whole company's infrastructure to the cloud. That's not just a technical challenge. It's a strategic one, too.</p>
<p>Yeah, there's a lot of planning involved in that. A lot of communication,</p>
<p>for sure. And his resume gives us some clues about how he approached it. He mentions prototyping systems using Capistrano, mechaniz, and selenium. Okay, now those are new ones for me. Break it down.</p>
<p>Think of it like this. Imagine you're moving a whole library from a physical building to an online platform. You wouldn't just pack up the books and ship them off.</p>
<p>No, you'd need some system for organizing them, making them searchable online.</p>
<p>Exactly. And that's kind of what these tools do for software.</p>
<p>Okay. So, they're all about automating and streamlining this move to the cloud.</p>
<p>Exactly. Capistrano helps automate deployments. Mechaniz lets you interact with websites automatically. Selenium is often used for testing. They all make the transition smoother.</p>
<p>It sounds like David wasn't just leaving the technical side, but also guiding his team through this cultural shift.</p>
<p>That's a great observation. He specifically mentions moving from a traditional data center culture to a more agile DevOps focused environment</p>
<p>which is a big change. And he even brings up SR code culture. What's SR?</p>
<p>SR stands for site reliability engineering. It's all about automating operations, preventing outages, making sure things are running smoothly. Think of them like the guardians of a website.</p>
<p>So, David is not only managing this complex move to the cloud, he's also introducing his team to this whole new way of working.</p>
<p>And you know, this focus on modern practices continues in his next role at Rent Jungle. Remember, weekly retrospectives, agile methods like affinity diagrams and pair work, even scrapey and tour for gathering data.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that's right. It's like he's always looking for the most efficient, cutting edge way to do things.</p>
<p>And he's doing all of this while leading teams, fostering collaboration, driving change within organizations. He really embodies that combination of technical expertise and leadership.</p>
<p>You know, as we've gone through David's resume, one thing's become clear. He's not just a software engineer. He's a problem solver, an innovator, a leader who's always growing and adapting.</p>
<p>And what's inspiring is that his resume doesn't just list accomplishments. It tells a story of continuous learning, a passion for using technology to make a real impact. It's like a blue print for building a meaningful career.</p>
<p>I love that. A blueprint. So, what can our listeners take away from this? What have we learned from diving deep into David's story?</p>
<p>I think the biggest lesson is the importance of continuous learning and adaptability. The tech world moves so fast. You got to be willing to embrace the new. Expand your skills. Step outside your comfort zone.</p>
<p>Absolutely. And it's not just about technical skills. Communication, collaboration, leadership, those are essential, too.</p>
<p>David's journey shows us that with passion, dedication and a hunger for knowledge, you can really make a difference. And that's something we can all aspire to no matter what field we're in.</p>
<p>Beautifully said. And with that, we wrap up our deep dive into the career of David Watson. Thank you so much for joining us.</p>
