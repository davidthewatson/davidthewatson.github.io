The Autonomy Tradeoff
We all make choices at different points in our lives that provide an arc to our existence. That arc covers time, place, and space. Why do I include space and place when they seem to cover the same thing?
The answer would be that place is obvious. Where am I, right here, right now? The paradox is that in the age of driverless cars,  autonomous robots, and smart phones ask and answer this question frequently and correctly given the ubiquity of GPS and time services. The irony is that as we have given the heare and now to robots, have we taken it away from humans?
Space is much less obvious, unless we're talking about the NASA definition.
What I'm talking about is the mental space, the space between, which we might call interstitial, metaphysical, or what the Japanese call ma.
