  <h1>Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6</h1>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>I'm not a doctor and this essay should not be taken as medical advice. It is an
honest review by a type 1 diabetic, including decades of day-to-day with
insulin pumps and years with Continuous Glucose Monitors (CGM). I've also
worked in medical devices and digital health.</p>
<h2>Diabetes Technology Ecosystem</h2>
<p>Any discussion of insulin pumps owes a debt of gratitude to Dean_Kamen. We are
standing_on_the_shoulders_of_giants.
nnnn</p>
<p>I also owe a debt of gratitude to a number of great endocrinologists from the
University of Pittsburgh and the certified diabetes educators who have helped
me over the years.</p>
<p>CDEs, in particular, deserve thanks and a raise for stretching themselves to
master such a complex device, pharmaceutical, and health insurance ecosystem
that is difficult for patients to traverse alone.
CDEs play a significant role in connecting the dots when patients are stuck
between the prescribing doctor and the durable medical equipment provider, the
pharmacy, and healtchare insurance provider without any idea where the system
is failing.</p>
<p>Without the helpers, I'd never be able to produce the results that I
demonstrate below, particularly given that I am highly active and fast
regularly, meaning that my basal rates have to be finely tuned or my diet,
exercise, and sleep become difficult to manage quickly. I have used 1, 2, and 3
day fasts for almost 15 years to tune my basal rnates as it is an effective
technique that is not difficult for me to manage, despite complaints from
doctors, dieticians, and CDEs. Fasting works, as Valter_Longo_and_others_have
demonstrated_with_fast-mimicking_diets.</p>
<p>Before I discuss the Tandem T-Slim X2 and Dexcom G6, a little background:
I was diagnosed with Type 1 diabetes as a child. While my disease is easier to
manage than most, my active lifestyle makes managing diabetes challenging due
to glycemic swings.</p>
<h2>You've Lost That Cyborg Feeling</h2>
<p>It's hard to describe the visceral feeling that comes from being device-
dependent when your life depends on it and the design and manufacturing of that
device is unreliable. I've had a bad experience with insulin pumps and
continuous glucose monitors for the last decade and after considering going
back to multiple daily injections and researching my next insulin pump and
continuous glucose monitor for months I moved on. I'm glad I did the research
because my experience with Tandem and Dexcom has been overwhelmingly positive,
despite challenges with complex digital diabetes ecosystem and supply chain
issues.</p>
<h2>Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6</h2>
<p>I got the Tandem t:slim X2 and Dexcom G6 on November 11, 2019, so as of
Veteran's Day 2020, I've spent a year with the device managing my day-to-day
blood glucose.</p>
<p>The timing of my purchase in the fall of 2019 meant that Tandem offered a free
upgrade to its Control IQ technology when the pump shipped with Basal IQ
technology installed. The long story short is that Basal IQ could prevent lows
by diminishing insulin supply but it could not do what Control IQ does which is
to provide increased basal rates and automatic correction boluses. I got the
upgrade from Basal IQ to Control IQ around late spring 2020. It has made a
difference in my control, particularly around exercise, sleep, and peace-of-
mind.</p>
<p>Basal IQ was a leap forward given its event-driven (closed-loop) nature, since
low blood sugars are high risk events that correlate with injury and death. By
comparison, Control-IQ is a quantum leap, since dosing on the high side is
still difficult, mostly owing to carb-to-insulin ratios and the guess work
involved in calculating doses between insulin-on-board and carbohydrate-on-
board. I'd like to say Control-IQ is like a 1-2 punch in diabetes control, but
that's understating the difficulty of lows around intense exercise and post-
prandial highs. There's more algorithmic development required to keep those
totally in check. But I'm splitting hairs - the difference between 70% in range
being good enough and 100% in range being perfect.</p>
<p>I expect the next few years will lead to algorithmic improvements that are
truly mind-blowing and remove the need for David Goggins levels of self-
regulation. In addition, I'm sure there are machine learning researchers
looking at this data now since Dexcom and Tandem have a treasure trove of
easily-anonymized data. Combine that data with data from a fitbit or Apple
Watch and you've got three pillars for significant improvement. The only thing
that leaves out is precise measurement of food in grams of carbohydrate. That
can be overcome with ketogenic diets as several proponents have demonstrated
and I've leaned in that direction for a decade or so. I link to some of those
proponents below.</p>
<p>Control IQ has sleep and exercise activities or modes. The exercise mode helps,
but it's generally not tunable enough to completely prevent lows around
exercise.</p>
<p>I can usually leave the pump on the default Control-IQ mode and get good but
not perfect results most of the time assuming no exercise and normal diet, but
the best results come from a_hack_that_I_learned_watching_a_youtube_video. That
is, use sleep mode to impose a lower target and more aggressive algorithmic
behavior to reach that 110 target. I leave the pump in sleep mode most of the
time. I get the best results when I use sleep mode 24x7x365, even when
exercising. I can go out now with a BG of 110 and run 5K at a moderate pace
with little rise or fall. That was never possible prior to my switch to using
sleep mode to manage exercise. It may be an outlier, but it works for me and
indeed, it's a game-changer.</p>
<h2>Reservoirs and Infusion Sets</h2>
<p>A big difference between the Tandem/Dexcom ecosystem and Minimed/Medtronic
ecosystem is disposable parts: reservoirs, infusion sets, sensors, and
transmitters. I'm not going to go into every detail here but my experience with
Dexcom/Tandem has been positive with few exceptions.</p>
<p>Before switching to Tandem/Dexcom, I'd had frequent issues with infusion site
redness, dislodged cannulas, and dislodged CGM sensors, regardless of insulin,
site change frequency, or location. After a year with the Tandem pump, I've had
zero issues with site redness after 365 days and not a single time that the
cannula dislodged from my skin in the same time period despite having dropped
the pump from waist high or caught the tubing on a door handle. I use 23"
tubing which puts the pump about knee high when it drops, so no damage occurs
from it hitting the floor.</p>
<h2>Software</h2>
<p>The software ecosystem evolving around these devices is growing rapidly, as the
devices have proliferated.</p>
<p>One thing that took me a few months to learn is that some of this software
ecosystem is free, open source, and of excellent quality while improving the
day-to-day disease management.</p>
<p>The ecosystem around DIY_Artificial_Pancreas_Systems_(APS) and Automated
Insulin_Delivery_(AID) is beyond the scope of this document, but this activity
has been evolving for several years and there is considerable tension between
regulators and the open source community.</p>
<p>The first insight for me when I got the X2:G6 combo was that it was tiresome to
reach for the pump frequently just to check my blood glucose.
Getting the BG from the Dexcom G6 on my phone took more effort because I have a
Google Pixel 4a, which was not supported by Dexcom at the time. Luckily,
there's a very capable individual doing custom_builds_of_the_Android_version_of
the_Dexcom_app on the internet. Just go through the form and you'll receive an
APK build that can be loaded on an unsupported phone like my Pixel. It has
worked perfectly for a year for me. That person deserves kudos!</p>
<p>Once I realized that checking BG on my phone was going to be nearly as tiresome
as on the insulin pump itself, I decided to check out watches, reflecting that
blood glucose is arguably the killer app for digital watches, especially for
someone who is highly active. I quickly realized that the Dexcom supported the
Apple Watch pretty well, but that wasn't an option for me having an Android
phone.</p>
<p>I was also concerned about the cost of the Apple ecosystem having used it
previously.</p>
<p>The real leap in learning came when I discovered an app_on_Github_that_runs_on
Fitbit_Versa and similar devices. A quick trip to BestBuy and some
configuration meant that I could track my BG on my wrist while exercising for a
little over $100. Glance has been a game changer for me since I use it daily
when running or walking the dog and at-a-glance while sleeping has alerted me
to problems that I otherwise would have missed. Kudos to Ryan_Mason!
Once you get past the excellent Dexcom Clarity app, the most well-designed of
the apps available is SugarMate. I use it everyday for information-rich spot
checks.Sugarmate joins the list of quick exit diabetes startups acquired by
either Dexcom or Tandem, like TypeZero.</p>
<h2>Usability</h2>
<p>Tandem x2:slim has thoughtful design. The direct manipulation interface that
Tandem presents on it's main screen is intuitive since you can just tap the 3
HR indicator to toggle through the hourly graph modes and tap the status
indicator to see status details.</p>
<p>That direct manipulation intuitiveness goes away when you descend into the
options menu. Most of these functions are not frequently accessed, so probably
aren't important day-to-day. However, the ones that are used more frequently do
not have the at-a-glance one tap reachability that they should while
discoverability is poor and menus are long and scrolling. The options menus
frequently require too many taps to reach the leaf node of the options tree.
When I first used the Tandem infusion sets and reservoirs, the design of the
injector and reservoir seemed weird. The crinkly sound of filling the
reservoirs as the bag expands with insulin and the transformer rocket launcher
design of the infusion sets had me puzzled. However, after a year of using them
daily, they seem clever and reliable. I've not had an infusion set fail due to
manufacturing issues.</p>
<p>The one issue that ignores is the sensor cost. Sensors are over $300 per box of
3, each with a 10 day usage, with a membership and a prescription at Costco
pharmacy. This is the best pricing I've found without US health insurance.
There is competition in CGMs, but that competition is limited, given that
integration with the insulin pump.</p>
<h2>Results</h2>
<p>I'm a big believer in evidence-based medicine. It's early but there's some
interesting evidence available already. The easiest way to demonstrate the
effectiveness of a medical device is 24x7x365 use for a year or so with
results. That population suvey is n_of_1 or quantified_self, and there's more
to it than just the medical device (diet, exercise, and self-regulation);
however, the medical device plays an outsized role in making good results
possible, probable, and predictable, if not perfect.</p>
<p>The gold standard of results in diabetes control is Hemoglobin A1c. My HbA1c
was 8.9 prior to acquiring the Tandem t:slim X2 in the fall of 2019, and it
tested in the same lab at 6.4 in February of 2020, below_the_diagnostic
threshold_for_type_1_diabetes, after only 3 months with the X2, G6, and Basal
IQ. I do not have a current result after my switch to Control IQ, but I expect
it to be similar since the math estimates - Dexcom's Glucose_Management
Indicator or GMI - essentially the variance of BG over time, show similar
numbers. I've found GMI to be conservative, meaning that GMI is generally
higher than my lab's HbA1c.</p>
<p>Regardless, the evidence speaks for itself. Prior to acquiring the X2 and G6, I
had no way of approaching perfect control, where perfect control is defined as
100% in range for T1D which is is generally accepted as 70-180. Today, I
routinely have days where my blood sugar is 100% in control and most days are
above the 70% in control benchmark, regardless of diet or exercise.
I owe a debt of gratitude to Keith_Runyan. His book has been helpful, though
more on diet and exercise than pumps or CGMs.</p>
<p>I've also found Ian_Lake's_website and Zero_Five_100 to be helpful.</p>
<p>Finally, Matt_Vande_Vegte has incredible content and led me to much of the
advice and conclusions that I mention here.</p>
<h2>Room for improvement</h2>
<p>Digital diabetes is a complex ecosystem owing to the integration of sensors and
mobile devices via bluetooth plus mobile devices and cloud systems via the 4G
LTE and the internet. The devices are complex even without wireless
connectivity but those things have only magnified the complexity and point to
the need for human-centered design, and a non-existent last mile geek squad of
technical support that is overwhelming doctors, diabetes educators, and
patients.</p>
<p>Design problems show up despite manufacturer's best efforts to solve them and I
believe this is a result of the aforementioned complexity. I have the benefit
of having worked in medical devices and digital health and so I can generally
intuit what's wrong when the system fails but there are at least a few cases
that were difficult to debug even for someone with a shared mental model,
technical depth and experience.</p>
<p>There are several incidents that are worth mentioning that demonstrate the
challenge that these companies face in overcoming the ecosystem complexity.
First, Dexcom and Tandem are not operating at NASA levels of technology
delivery maturity. They are doing well enough to survive and perhaps thrive in
the market, but there are cracks in the safety armor.</p>
<p>Almost a year ago, not long after I got the Dexcom G6, the blood glucose
readouts and notifications that would typically show up on my watch or phone
suddenly stopped and didn't start working for several days. This was widely
reported on the internet and reached major news sites such as the Wall_Street
Journal.</p>
<p>This situation raises the need for vigilance on the part of patients,
caregivers, and everyone in the technology support system to be aware that the
publish-subscribe system employed by Dexcom to publish bluetooth data
originating from the sensor to it's subscribers (which may be everything from
the patient's watch to a parent's smart phone or other_app) was dependent on a
single point of failure in the cloud.</p>
<p>I believe Dexcom learned its lesson with crisis PR, as the company now has
better_status_mechanisms in place, but there were a tense few days, not so much
for people like me - I can live without my watch displaying blood glucose - but
for parents with diabetic children or the like.
Second, Tandem's software quality problems have played out slightly
differently. The company was slow to market with a mobile app that interfaced
with the t:slim X2, but once delivered, the app seemed polished and
professional.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, that polish was a facade. The app worked well most of the time
but as I spent more time with it, I realized that there were serious latency
and queuing problems plaguing the app. This latency and queuing plague is so
serious that I've considered uninstalling the Tandem app from my phone.
In short, what happens is that notifications from the pump are queued and not
displayed on the phone until hours after the events that triggered them.
This may seem like a minor annoyance until you consider that those events are
important, like insulin delivery stopped and inherently timely, like receiving
the insulin delivery stopped notification when insulin delivery is not actually
stopped hours later or vice versa.</p>
<p>The implication of this is that the state machine that has to be managed by the
mobile app is out-of-synch with the insulin pump itself. The worse implication
would be that there is no state machine in the design.
This is a huge safety hole, one that I hope doesn't wind up causing injury or
harm because it could be easily misread and lead to bad dosing decisions on the
part of the patient or caregivers.</p>
<p>At a minimum, the app designers need to consider the cognitive dissonance that
occurs when the patient receives a notification that they know is out of synch
with the pump.This kind of latency may be fine in text messaging, but the
design consideration in medical devices should be a serious safety concern.
Third, the challenge of producing a system that is a collaborative venture
between two companies such as Dexcom and Tandem, and the G6 and t:slim X2,
respectively, is that the customer experience should not be concerned with
crossing the chasm between Dexcom and Tandem, either legally, technically, or
in terms of supply chain and support.</p>
<p>The past year has been challenging for everyone providing remote technical
support, as many systems were not up to the challenge of scaling to support so
many simultaneous connections, both human and machine.</p>
<p>However, where this shows up with Dexcom and Tandem is when a device or a
disposable component malfunctions, it can be confusing to navigate help lines,
web sites, and email addresses without a single, unified entry point into such
systems. Patients deserve better. I believe Tandem and Dexcom are working hard
to improve the disconnects, but it has been challenging when support needs to
transit a complex ecosystem of email, web, and phone. That said, I've had a
positive experience with both Tandem and Dexcom support and they've always
followed through when the products and services malfunctioned. Most commonly,
this has been with Dexcom's G6 transmitter batteries. They frequently failed
before their 90 day expiry and this has been resolved every time with a
warranty replacement, and a sensor to account for the wasted sensor owing to
the transmitter change.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>The following recommendations are made with a year of experience in the Dexcom
G6 integrated with Tandem t:slim X2.
   1. The Tandem Android app should have its latency problems fixed in a safe
      and reliable way. The state that the app reports should never be
      different than the insulin pump. The safety implications of decisions
      made on erroneous alerting should be obvious.
   2. Brand and product support should be wholly integrated such that the
      customer experience has exactly one 800 number, or email, or similar -
      not two or more.
   3. Activity modes (exercise and sleep) should be parameterized. This should
      include at least target BG since default targets may be too high or low
      for a particular user.</p>
