  <h1>Why Human Computer Insight?</h1>
<p>I've been peeking and poking at personal computers since I was 12,
what we'd hall human-computer interaction or HCI. </p>
<p>However, when I started working with GPT post-2020 in a series of experiments,the feeling that I got from the work was not that AI had taken on consciousness, or sentience. </p>
<p>Rather, it was as if my collaboration with the computer was increasingly bi-directional, or of mutual benefit to me and the technology, that the technology was gaining as much from the process as I was.</p>
<p>That's where words like human computer interaction seemed to fall flat. At that point, I started using words like human computer collaboration, contemplation, and insight to describe it.</p>
<p>The results were much closer to <strong>sensemaking, spiritual, or transcendent</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>That is, more like art <em>than</em> science. Or like education, art <em>and</em> science.</strong></p>
<p>Many of the insights are more like the soft sciences (qualitative and phenomenological) and less like the hard sciences (quantitative and empirical).</p>
<p>That's OK. Education can benefit across the spectrum from cradle to crave. </p>
<p>Young and old alike benefit when education gets an inexpensive, positive, and scalable  pairing partner between teachers and students. </p>
<p>When that partner provides mutual benefit, reduces cognitive load bidirectionally, and suggest novel directions for exploration, everyone wins! </p>
<p>Those outcomes will never be equaled by a static encyclopedia.</p>
<p>Reflecting on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Spiritual_Machines">Ray Kurzweil's 1999 book</a>, it's much easier today to see why he chose <strong><em>spiritual</em></strong> in the title, rather than <strong>conscious or sentient</strong>. </p>
