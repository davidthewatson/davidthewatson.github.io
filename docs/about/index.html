  <h5>About</h5>
<p>I'm into <a href="#health">health</a>, <a href="#music">music</a>, and <a href="#software">software</a>.</p>
<p>My compulsion with health is simple. My diagnosis with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus at age 7 imparted a certain premature-maturity on me. </p>
<p>I responded as best I could by studying biology and  chemistry in elementary school. </p>
<p>As a teenager, I was invited and joined the board of directors of my local American Diabetes Association chapter.</p>

<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/jade.jpg" alt="Jade" title="Jade"></img> </p>
<p>Healthcare is self-care, at least in the United States.</p>
<p>I've discovered that, from Shorthairs to Weimaraners to Vizslas, pointers have a way of moving me. Like a nomad, I'm always on the run. From what, I'm not exactly sure. The rolling stone gathers no moss.</p>
<p>But before I was on the run, my teenage adulation of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/breaking-away-was-this-actors-breakout-role-
fans-say-it-changed-their-lives-too">Breaking Away</a> ended with a spectacular bike
crash. Slow jogging long distances has taught me that <a href="https://read.gov/aesop/025.html">the race is not always to the swift</a>. </p>
<p>I've spent a lifetime learning from my childhood diabetes diagnosis by building a protocol of feasting, fasting, and exercise.</p>
<p><strong>My life's purpose is to ameliorate diabetes for myself and others.</strong> </p>
<p>Why ameliorate? Well, consider the definition:</p>
<dl>
<dt>ameliorate</dt>
<dd>make something bad better or more tolerable</dd>
</dl>

<p>Of course, I can't actually cure diabetes, but the <a href="https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/a-diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-reverse-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/#:~:text=Longo%20and%20his%20team%20also,could%20alleviate%20diabetes%20in%20humans.">path</a> to <a href="https://www.valterlongo.com/diabetes-obesity/">remission</a> is <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357144/">clear</a> and the milestones are <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/health-39070183">clearer</a> yet. Many of those milestones emerged recently:</p>
<ul>
<li>2019<ul>
<li>Adopted a whole-foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet <ul>
<li>Lost ~23 Kg in the process </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2021<ul>
<li>Finished the Belmar Bridge half marathon <ul>
<li>Medaled in my age group</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>HbA1c reached 6.0, below the threshold of T1D diagnosis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2022<ul>
<li>Finished the Pittsburgh Marathon</li>
<li>Near slowest marathon times recorded<ul>
<li>First half matched my half-marathon (2:10)</li>
<li>Second half took <strong>4 hours</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Rain reminded me of winter 98-99 in Seattle (El Niño)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2023<ul>
<li>Shut off my insulin pump for the first time in over two decades</li>
<li>I shed a tear when the cyborg shadow I'd been haunted by vanished</li>
<li>Started work on my book about my unique approach to diabetes</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>2024<ul>
<li>Completed the South Park half marathon</li>
</ul>

<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/tama.jpg" alt="Drums" title="Drums"></img></p>
<p>For me, drums made jazz approachable when I was too young and didn't possess the fine motor control skills to master the feel (exteroception). I'm still learning. </p>
<p>Live, acoustic, trio fusion is where I find peace. Some call it <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_stream">third stream</a> which curiously pre-dates <em>fusion</em>. </p>
<p>I planned to be a classical musician, but I gave up my music scholarship when I dropped out of music school to study computer
science instead. My parents said that <em>The Corporation</em> would pay the rent until I realized that my gig money paid the mortgage. I spent years gigging so my time learning music was well-spent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/jazz-is-freedom-grimstad">beauty of jazz</a> as an art form is that it depends on the artist, the listener, and the artist-listener. Jazz is the greatest triumph of listening as art. 
Take a bassist like Ron Carter, a drummer like Bryan Blade, a guitarist like Pat Metheny, and a pianist like Marcin Wasilewski, then listen carefully to their transcendent sound. </p>

<h6><a name="software"></a>Software</h6>
<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/computer.jpg" alt="Studio" title="Studio"></img> </p>
<p>Software started as a <em>personal</em> science for me as an adolescent - peeking and poking at <em>personal</em> computers. </p>
<p>Decades later I practice software as experiments in art and intuitive philosophy, like my <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/">heroes</a>. </p>
<p>I've been fortunate to work across the entire spectrum of software from microcomputing to macrocomputing. </p>
<p>My work has spanned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf">APIs</a> and  <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/product-portfolio/automation-point">Automation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nomos.com/pdf/BN_MB_Corvus_MSF0003_R1_06142016.pdf">Cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps#:~:text=they%20craft%20glucose%20meters%20for%20diabetics">Diabetes</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps">Design</a> and <a href="/cobind_retrospective.html">Startups</a> </li>
</ul>
<p>But nothing has influenced my work more than open source's 3 P's: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment">ProxMox</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Python</a>.</p>

software. <footer>- <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a></cite></footer></p>

<hr>
<p>What code and jazz share beyond four-letter-words is that both result from ephemeral, liminal, modal consciousness and context beyond language. Indeed, in terms of language, one is compulsively logical while the other is impulsively emotional. </p>
