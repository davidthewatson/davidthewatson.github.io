  <h5>About Dave</h5>
<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/watson.png" alt="Dave" title="Dave"></img> </p>

<p>I've lived in Boston and Seattle, but <a href="/philosophy/between_buddhism_middle_way_and_japanese_ma.html">Pittsburgh</a> is home - an <a href="https://www.wesa.fm/identity-community/2021-12-11/what-is-appalachia-heres-what-people-from-around-the-region-including-pittsburgh-have-to-say">Appalachian rust-belt reflection</a> of what once was great between the <a href="https://bankerandtradesman.com/on-route-128-a-history-of-constant-innovation/">128 beltway</a> and <a href="https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/the-valley-of-my-dreams-why-silicon-valley-left-bostons-route-128-in-the-dust/">Silicon Valley</a>. Pittsburgh is the place where, like New England and the Pacific Northwest, the <a href="https://profpeaton.com/2015/09/13/starting-with-dewey-education-as-science-or-art/#:~:text=Education%20is%20not%20either%20an%20art%20or%20a,%E2%80%9Csciences%E2%80%9D%20that%20impact%20our%20systematic%20understanding%20of%20education">arts, sciences, and education</a> transcend a history of collaborative innovation. I've learned and grown from that history while enjoying the nature they share. 
My life has been divided among 3 things:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#health">Health</a></li>
<li><a href="#music">Music</a></li>
<li><a href="#software">Software</a></li>

<p><a href="https://www.fairobserver.com/more/science/screen-addiction-technology-news-overusing-computer-screens-science-news-38012/">Staring into screens may seem like human nature</a>, but I'm too hyperkinetic. I've discovered that, from Shorthairs to Weimaraners to Vizslas, pointers have a way of making 
a hyperactive feel lazy. Like a nomad, I'm always on the run. From what, I'm not exactly sure. The rolling stone gathers no moss.</p>
<p>My teenage adulation of <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/breaking-away-was-this-actors-breakout-role-
fans-say-it-changed-their-lives-too">Breaking Away</a> ended with a spectacular bike
crash. Slow jogging long distances has taught me that <a href="https://read.gov/aesop/025.html">the race is not always to the swift</a>. </p>
<p>I've spent a lifetime recovering from my early childhood diabetes diagnosis by building an organic protocol of cycling, feasting, fasting, meditating, running, and resting.</p>
<p><em>Diabetes diagnosis is a lesson in disguise,<br>
Repeated trauma from diagnosis to demise,<br>
Diabetes is an education by improvisation,<br>
A data dissertation sans orchestration.</em></p>

<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/tama.jpg" alt="Drums" title="Drums"></img></p>
<p>For me, drums made jazz approachable until my mind, body, and soul coalesced. I'm still learning. Classics have their place, but 
live trio fusion is where I find peace. </p>
<p>I planned to be a classical musician, but I gave up my music scholarship to study computer
science. My parents said a good corporate job would pay the rent until I realized that my gig money paid the mortgage. I spent years gigging so my time learning music was well-spent.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thebaffler.com/salvos/jazz-is-freedom-grimstad">beauty of jazz</a> as an art form is that it depends on the artist, the listener, and the artist-listener. Jazz is the greatest triumph of listening as art. 
Take a bassist like Ron Carter, a drummer like Bryan Blade, a guitarist like Pat Metheny, and a pianist like Marcin Wasilewski, then listen carefully to their transcendent sound. </p>

<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/computer.jpg" alt="Studio" title="Studio"></img> </p>
<p>Software started as a <em>personal</em> science for me - peeking and poking at <em>personal</em> computers.</p>
<p>Decades later, I'd realize that <a href="https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc">Xerox PARC's formative years</a> 
coincided with  my early childhood education.
Five years later, we breathed software
from Apple to Atari and beyond. No surprise, then, that our school resembled a mix of 
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay#Subsequent_work">Alan Kay's employers</a> and 
<a href="/people/bill_gates_at_lakeside.html">Bill Gates schooling</a>. </p>
<p>From graduating high school to graduating college, the timing of innovation continued with my favorite database, operating system, and programming language: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm">Michael Stonebraker</a> released Postgres</li>
<li>Guido van Rossum released Python </li>
<li>Linus Torvalds released Linux</li>
</ul>
<p>In a decade, open source software (OSS) established itself as a viable alternative to established commercial software. 
The cultural transformation would take another decade. Nothing has influenced my work more than using Linux, Postgres, and Python. My work has spanned:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf">APIs</a> and  <a href="https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/product-portfolio/automation-point">Automation</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.nomos.com/pdf/BN_MB_Corvus_MSF0003_R1_06142016.pdf">Cancer</a> and <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps#:~:text=they%20craft%20glucose%20meters%20for%20diabetics">Diabetes</a> </li>
<li><a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps">Design</a> and <a href="/collaboration/cobind_retrospective.html">Startups</a> </li>
</ul>

<p>It is software that gives form and purpose to
a programmable machine, much as a sculptor shapes clay. Leonardo called music

software. <footer>- <cite><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay">Alan Kay</a></cite></footer></p>
