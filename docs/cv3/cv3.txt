Hey everyone, welcome back. Ready for another deep dive?

Always

awesome. Today we're taking a look at David Watson's career uh based on his resume. And wow, this is going to be interesting.

Yeah, just skimming it, I was really struck by well the variety. This isn't just someone who stayed in one lane, you know?

No, definitely not. Okay, so right off the bat, we see a computer science award, then a computer programming internship, but hold on. In between those, there's music school. What's going on here?

It makes you wonder, right? Like, did those things somehow connect for him later on. Music, I mean it takes a ton of creativity, structure, problem solving even. Does that translate to tech?

Yeah. Like some left brain, rightrain magic applied to his whole career.

Yeah.

And then early on he co-founds cobain. I got to ask for those of us who weren't around back then, what was the big deal about uh binding an app with its OS?

So think of it as like way early containerization, custom Linux distros, they were getting popular then cobb they were kind of packaging software for specific setups ahead of their time really.

And they got worldwide press after an idea foundry fellowship. That's not just an idea, that's making it happen.

But then we see a shift, right? Startup founder to software engineer at places like Maya Design and Nomos.

It's a classic dilemma. Startup life all exciting and risky versus a bigger company more stable. What do you think might have driven that change?

Hard to say without knowing him, right? Maybe new challenges or gaining experience in that kind of environment shows he's adaptable. for sure. And speaking of which, the tech he's worked with, it's a lot. C++, Python, Docker, Kubernetes, the list goes on.

And each of those, those are big developments in the software world. So, it's not just knowing languages, it's keeping up with what's new, constantly learning, essential in tech, right?

Totally. And at hire leaving a team of six through a whole Python 3 redesign. Plus, at Caterpillar, he tackled this big C++ code optimization project, boosting performance by, get this, 20 to 50%. Yeah, that's not just coding. That's serious skill. But he also at hire and esquire really cut down on production issues. Agile methodologies, automated tests, CI/CD. He got it all going. That's understanding the whole software life cycle.

And similar thing at Wellspring Worldwide leading them to NSRE culture, site reliability engineering. For anyone new to the term, it's about making systems super reliable, scalable.

Yeah, it's a whole mindset shift thinking about how to build and operate like the Googles and Amazons of the world. So, we're seeing leadership here, not just a title, but actually taking charge and making things better.

Oh, and then there's this project at Rent Jungle. He developed a Scrappy Tour web crawler. Now, Scrapey, that's for extracting data from websites. Tour, that's the anonymizing thing, right? What was he up to there?

Sounds like some discrete data gathering was needed. You think about rent juggle, they need info on rental prices, trends, competitors, probably stuff not easy to find out in the open.

Ah, like digital detective work. And of course, built on a solid backend, Django. Postgres school and surprise Kubernetes it's almost his trademark showing up again and again

shows he gets scalable cloudnative solutions Kubernetes it's like the conductor of the orchestra for modern apps keeps everything running smoothly

so we've got early entrepreneurial drive serious technical chops and now this understanding of building systems that can handle growth what else jumps out at you from this first part of his career

well the speed for one at forever he prototyped a whole full stack cloud app in just two weeks Python on three and Heroku. This was before serverless was a thing. So Heroku back then that was impressive.

Two weeks he must love a challenge. And this was right after developing, get this, conversational tech systems like early chat bots at Smash, big clients, too. Pittsburgh Steelers, Miller Corores.

So not just coding fast, but getting what clients need, building for big brands. That's a valuable combo.

Definitely not your average coder, that's for sure. A problem solver, a leader, a fast learner. What strikes you as, I don't know, the most remarkable thing so far from what we've seen? It's really how he combines the technical side with like getting the business needs. Not just building stuff, but building the right stuff. That webcwler for Ren Jungle, those chat bots for the Steelers that stands out.

Yeah. Connecting the dots between tech and what people actually need. And speaking of connections, at Wellbridge Health, he led a four-person design team, created an Ember SPA MVP, single page web app for those who don't know the acronym, and they did this with Maya Design, so collabor ation too.

So he's bridging design and development. Super important these days, right? User experience is everything. He wasn't just backend. He was in on shaping what the user sees.

And on top of that, IT compliance officer at Wellbridge too. Not just a coder, but gets the whole business picture, knows about regulations, all that

valuable skill set, especially in deals with, you know, strict rules. It's responsibility, attention to detail, goes beyond just the code itself.

Always pushing himself. That's clear. Then there's applied perception where he get this visualized XML sonar data. I got to ask, what does that even mean for those of us who aren't like sonar experts?

So, imagine raw sonar data, just a bunch of signals and readings. Hard to make sense of. He probably used some specialized tools to turn that into well, something you can actually see and understand.

So, coding to solve a real problem, pulling insights out of data. But wait, there's more. He ported a Microsoft C.NET Windows GUI to C++ QT Linux. Big change there. What's the significance? It means he can work across platforms, languages. Porting software isn't easy. You got to really understand both sides.

Like being fluent in multiple coding languages, Andy being able to translate between them. And back at Nomos earlier on, he's developing C++ QA tests, maintaining a Pearl code review system.

And this was in a highly regulated environment, FDA regulated radiotherapy products. So think about it. Software bugs there. That's serious. Not just a website crashing. It's people's health.

Huge responsibility. It's amazing. He starts there. with the basics of testing and code quality, then goes on to lead teams, start companies.

It's a solid foundation, right?

Yeah.

Starting with those fundamentals, it sets you up for success anywhere in software.

Okay. So, we've got technical depth, leadership is connecting tech to the real world. What bigger themes are you seeing as we piece this career together?

I keep coming back to well, embracing different experiences. He doesn't just stick to one thing. He seeks out challenges even outside his comfort zone and it seems to work for him.

It's that yes and approach always adding more to a skill set definitely paying off.

Yeah, it makes you rethink that straight line career path, right?

How can things that seem unrelated actually work together?

Instead of either it's yes and how can we apply that to ourselves whether we're just starting out or been at it for a while?

Well, start with what you love, even if it seems totally separate from your job. What makes you excited? What are you curious about? Then try to connect that to your work even in small ways. You never know. what you'll find

like planting seeds, right? Some grow, some don't. But exploring those options, that's where growth comes from.

And continuous learning. Can't forget that. His resume, it shows he's always on top of what's new, always learning more. And in tech, that's essential. But it's not just courses and certificates, right? It's being curious, seeking challenges, pushing your boundaries.

Exactly. Read, go to conferences, join online groups, talk to people with different viewpoints. Make it a habit.

And don't be afraid to try and fail. failure. It's just another way to learn.

And leadership, we've seen that throughout his career, leading teams, changing the culture, just taking charge to make things better.

It's not about titles. It's about impact, inspiring people, making real change.

And we can all do that no matter where we are in our careers. Mentor someone, share what you know, champion new ideas, push for positive change.

Even small things can make a difference. Create a better workplace for everyone.

And lastly, that person wellbeing part,

listing his passions on his resume. It's a reminder we're not robots, we're people. We have other interests, needs, outside work.

Easy to forget that in the hustle, right? But if we don't take care of ourselves mentally, physically, it affects everything.

So, make time for what brings you joy, recharge, nourish your soul. A well-rounded life is a better life, and that makes you better at work, too.

So, we've got diverse experiences, continuous learning, leadership, and taking care of yourself. What stands out to you the most,

honestly? how he went to music school.

Mhm.

Makes you think maybe that's part of what makes him so good at this stuff.

Yeah. It's like a hidden advantage, a different way of seeing things. Maybe that's what sets him apart.

Not just being different for the sake of it, but being open to new possibilities, new ways of thinking. That's where innovation comes from, right?

It's inspiring for sure to see someone make their own path, go against expectations, and build a career that's both unique and impactful.

Makes you wonder what skills or experiences do we have that we're not using? What connections are we missing?

Great questions to think about. But before we wrap up, there's one last thing on his resume I want to mention. His personal passions. He lists diet, exercise, reading, writing, and running.

Interesting. It's like, yeah, your career is important, but it's not everything. Take care of yourself, have other interests, find that balance.

Easy to get caught up in the tech world and think you got to be coding all the time, but this shows maybe a well-rounded life actually makes you better at your job. Those passions, they could be what makes them so resilient, creative, focused. It's a reminder we're not machines, we're human.

And when we take care of ourselves mentally and physically, we bring our best to work. So, as we finish up this part of the deep dive, what's resonating with you the most?

What surprised you? What inspired you? Did any of this make you think about your own career differently?

All right, so we've gone through a lot here with David Watson's career from those early startup days to some pretty serious technical stuff. But what is it all? I don't know. What's the takeaway for us the listeners?

That's the important part, right? Not just looking at what he did, but figuring out what we can learn from it, apply it to our own careers.

Exactly. So, if we had to pick like the top lessons from all this, what would you say are the most important things we can take away from David's story?

Well, first off, don't be afraid to try different things to have a variety of experiences. I mean, music, starting a business, deep tech skills, even that focus on taking care of himself. It all comes together to make him well impressive, right?

It's like he said yes to everything. Always adding new skills, new experiences, and it's definitely working out for him.

For sure. It makes you think maybe that straight line career path, maybe it's not the only way. Maybe those unrelated interests, they can actually make you stronger.

So, instead of thinking either this or that, it's more like yes. And how can we actually put that into practice in our own lives? Whether we're just just starting out or we've been doing this for a while.

Start with what you love. Even if it has nothing to do with your job right now. What are you excited about? What are you curious about? Then see if you can connect that to your work. Even just a little bit. You might be surprised what happens.

Like planting seeds. Some grow, some don't. But you got to try, right? That's how you find new opportunities.

And never stop learning. That's another big one. His resume shows he's always staying up to date, learning new skills. And in tech, that's crucial. Things change. so fast.

But learning isn't just about taking classes, right? It's about being curious, always looking for new challenges, even if they make you a little uncomfortable.

Exactly. Read books, go to conferences, join those online groups, talk to people who see things differently than you. Make learning part of your life always.

And don't be afraid to try things and maybe even fail sometimes. Failing, it's just another way to learn and get better.

Now, leadership. Yeah,

we've seen how he's been a leader throughout his career, leading team. teams, changing how things are done, just taking charge and making things better.

And it's not about having a fancy title or managing people. It's about making a real difference, inspiring others, and pushing for positive change.

And we can all do that. No matter what our job is or how much experience we have, mentor someone. Share what you know. Speak up for new ideas. Try to make your workplace better.

Even small things can add up. Create a better environment for everyone.

And last, but not least, remember to take care of yourself. Him putting his passion on his resume. It's a little thing, but it says a lot. It's like, yeah, work is important, but it's not everything. You got to have other things in your life, things you enjoy.

Yeah, it's easy to get caught up in the tech world and think all that matters is coding, coding, coding. But this shows maybe having a life outside of work actually makes you better at your job.

Those passions, maybe that's what gives him energy, helps him be creative, stay focused. We're not just machines, we're people. We need those things.

And when we take care of ourselves mentally and physically, physically we do better work. So to wrap up this whole deep dive, I want to go back to the beginning. What was it about David Watson's resume that made us want to talk about him today?

Honestly, for me, it was that he went to music school. It made me think maybe that's part of what makes him so good at this tech stuff.

Yeah. Like a secret weapon, a different way of looking at things. Maybe that's his superpower.

Not just being different for the sake of it, but being open to new possibilities, new ways of thinking. That's where innovation comes from, right?

And isn't that what we all want? in our careers to be innovative, to make a real impact.

Absolutely. So, as we finish up today, we leave you with this. What's your unique blend? What skills, experiences, and passions do you have that can make a difference in the world?

Find it, explore it, and don't be afraid to try new things. You never know where it might lead you.

And that's it for our deep dive today. See you next time.
