<h1>davidwatson.org</h1> <h4>My name is Watson, DÃ¤v Watson. <p>Dropped
out of music school, launched a music education program, won a fellowship,
<a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1191/">cofounded a tech startup</a>, all
before taking a pregnant pause at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020,
after reading <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-Fu
Lee</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell">Stuart
Russell</a>, and <a href="https://futureoflife.org/person/max-tegmark/">Max
Tegmark</a> before quietly resigning. <p>The hauntological debt lingers.
<p>Let's just say I understood why <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geoffrey_Hinton">Geoffrey Hinton</a> took a low flying
aircraft to The University of Toronto around the Summer of Connectionism
in 1987.
<p>Somewhere along the way, I read the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrivium">quadrivium</a>, connected the dots, and realized why, when I interviewed at Microsoft in 1997, the director of program management in Windows Engineering at Building 27 had a PhD in Music from Eastman and the #1 Computer Scientist on earth in the last fifty years wrote The <em>ART</em> of computer programming. Ours is a very scientistic science!
<p>I love to chat with different people who put community
potential  above commercial profit, like my clan lurking between <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manchester_Craftsmen%27s_Guild">MCG</a>
(where I saw <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tK-hfpvwivg">The Bad
Plus</a>) and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Get_Hip_Records">Get Hip
Records</a> next door in Pittsburgh. <p>Happiest scaling 2 guys-in-a-garage to
pizza teams before brains need bandannas to find the path of least resistance in in meatspace between explosion
and implosion.
<p>Why would you carry a toxic cocaine brick in your pocket if you already have Gelertner's mirror world between your ears?
Caveat Emptor! You can't trust the masked man called big tech in the United States any further than you can throw your toxic cocaine brick!
<h3>
Alien Intelligence in Outer Space vs. Inner Space
<h4>
What if the real alien intelligence we should worry about is not from outer space, but the innter space from within our own minds?

This idea is worth exploring, especially if we consider that our internal experiences might be just as understandable as external ones. To make sense of this, we need a new approach, one that uses advanced mathematical models, like those developed by Grothendieck, to account for the disconnected, dynamic, and ephemeral nature of our thoughts and feelings.
