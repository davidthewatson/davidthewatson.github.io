<h4>past</h4>
<p>I'm a guy from a tiny town near <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a> called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fallston,_Pennsylvania">Fallston</a>.
<p>My childhood in small-town Pennsylvania yielded a <a href="https://aeon.co/essays/it-takes-psychological-flexibility-to-thrive-with-chronic-illness">diabetes diagnosis</a>, an avocation, and a vocation.
<p>First,diabetes declared war on my pancreas. That war had been raging for eons across the globe until the <a href="/essays/diabetes/gratitude_for_nobel_prize_winners.html">discovery of insulin</a>.
<p>Second, music became my passion. I decided in music school that music wouldn't pay the rent before making music my avocation only to find out ironically later, that music did pay the mortgage.
<p>Third, technology became my life-long obsession, then, a decade later, my vocation upon completion of a computer science internship.
<p>At that point, my career path was clear.
</div>
<div clss="col-4">
<h4>present</h4>
<p>My present is shaped by contemplation - a daily habit of contemplating diabetes, music, and technology. 
<p><a href="/essays/diabetes/diabetes_mastery_in_2022.html">
Mastering diabetes requires contemplation.</a>
<p>Meanwhile, I still have a few drums - both analog and digital - collecting dust at home, along with an analog turntable from the seventies.
<p>For fun and inspiration, I listen to emergent acoustic fusion but I play with Logic Pro X on Mac along with a <a href="/essays/music/tama_starclassic_bubinga_drums_and_meinl_extra_dry_cymbals.html">Novation MIDI Controller, Roland V-Drums, and Tama Bubinga drum kit</a>. 
<p>While diabetes keeps me busy, and music soothes my soul, technology pays the bills.
<p>Professionally, tap the purple portrait to read the whole story.
<p>Personally, my tech obsessions are simple to state: open source, git, linux, python, postgresql, sway.

<summary>About David Watson
<img class="portrait-img" src="/images/watson.jpg">
</summary>
<p>I help teams design, develop, and deploy software. Desktop to mobile, data center to cloud, containers to kubernetes: emerging technology is my focus.
<p>I work with organizations like R&D labs, software companies, or startups that are a pivot from becoming a software company, or being acquired by one.
<p>My career has followed web, mobile, and robotics technologies into autonomy, healthcare, and other domains that are ripe for disruption.
<p>I'm particularly interested in areas with organic complexity waiting to be overcome by an engineering approach that uses a lean cycle and <a href="https://www.leadingagile.com/2017/06/whos-afraid-of-emergent-design/">emergent design</a> to make progress.
<p>I'm casting about for my next opportunity, if you'd like to learn more, please see my <a href="/resume/">resume</a>.
