<p>My journey straight outta startups landed in Boston, giving it an old world feel while El Nino's rain rendered the next leg of my tech transition to sleepless in Seattle soggy, by comparison. El Nino made me shiver, but I miss the foothills of the Cascades far more.
<p>Invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and the cooperation they require if and when capital meets care in concert. That's only a given if we flex and freeze like Walter Payton. Balancing thinking and feeling is the chalenge.
<p>People succeed in software by reminding themselves that software is a cooperative learning game.  Modeling people in software is now easier than modeling software in people.
That's exactly why we should be optimistic. At least we have plenty of data on people, no matter the dark world that generated it.
<p>If we envision AI as tools, where AI is Actual Intelligence with Human-In-The-Loop feedback, we may be the benefactors of the human:computer sensemaking revolution. Care, oversight, and structured interlocution may be all that we're missing rom kids to elders.
Fortunately, structured interlocution implies teachable moments.
<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care.
I'm happiest building communities from peer:pairs by sizing versus politicizing pizza teams.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought for the last decade is alive and well at the Lincoln Library at Carnegie Library Music Hall in Carnegie, PA -  a beacon of light illuminating the Oaks all the way down the hill to the former Post Office turned Carnegie Coffee community below - a wonderful place where I've met countless caring coworkers of dramatically different but strangely similar stripes.
The Lincoln Library stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.
