<p>My name is David.</p>
<p>
Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I rant, rave, and ramble about diabetes, technology, and occasionally diabetes technology.
</p>
<p>
I've been diabetic for most of my life, worn an insulin pump for over two decades, and used a Continuous Glucose Monitor (CGM) off and on for ten years, and 24x7x365 for the last two years. Now, I wear two CGM's concurrently! Long story.
</p>
<p>
While I don't have a medical degree, I do have years of experience working in both medical devices and healthcare, so I can speak from experience both as a patient and provider delivering technology solutions targeting patients just like me. 
</p>

<p>
I also grew up a latchkey kid where the doctor's office was on the walk home from school to home, so watching pros practice medicine, demo their tools, and lead others through daily healthcare struggles rubbed off on me in a good way. 
</p>

<p>
I was a member of the board of directors of my local American Diabetes Association chapter when I was just a teenager.
</p>
<p>
I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
</p>
<p>
When I'm not hyperfocused on these things, I am active outdoors, cycling, walking my dog, Jade the Viszla, or doing the Maffetone shuffle otherwise known as running.
</p>
<p>
So have a look around and reach out if you'd like to work together. 
</p>
<p>
Thanks for visiting!
