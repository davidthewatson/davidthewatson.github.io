<h4>Modeling humans in software > modeling software in humans.</h4>
<h3>We need softer humans, not harder software.</h3>
<article id="topmost">

<p>We should be optimistic. We have data on people.

The data we have on software has already been weaponized to trim troves of humans from software.

That's the wrong direction.

Instead, we should aim that weapon at building better learning, better leading, and better people from diet, health, nutrition, school, and elderly care. Well-being, for lack of a better word. 

<p>Humans who understand cash better than computers have tried to turn coders into human robots exactly as we've seen with HR, without their consent.

<p>Emotion matters as much in code as it did in empathy.

<p><strong>Why?</strong>

<p>Because software is <em>emotional communication</em> like music.

<p>The Greeks saw this at the Quadrivium.

<p>Emotion may be the only thing separating human consciousness from oversimplified machine intelligence found in AI and IQ. They share the same over-used word: <strong>intelligence</strong>.

<p>Eventually we'll realize the problem is dramatically deeper than AI or IQ. Hopefully, history will record our development of a lossy proxy like IQ to the age when we thought AI was the solution. Sigh.

<p>The consequences are obvious.

<h4>Actual Intelligence > artificial intelligence</h4>

<p>If we envision AI as tools instead of trauma, we may be the benefactors of the <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf">human:computer sensemaking revolution</a>,
where we learn, grow, and thrive.

<p>Care, oversight, and structured interlocution are required from kids to elders.

<h4>Structured interlocution = teachable moments</h4>

<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought is alive and well at the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/civil-war-room/the-lincoln-gallery/">Lincoln Gallery</a>. A beacon of light and learning which illuminates the Red Oaks all the way down to <a href="https://www.carnegiecoffeecompany.com/">Carnegie Coffee</a> community below.
The Lincoln Gallery stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.
