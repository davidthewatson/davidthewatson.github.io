<h3>We need softer humans, not harder software.</h3>
<h4>Hence, model humans in software, not  software in humans.</h4>
<article id="topmost">

<p>We have data on people, no matter the intent of those who gathered it.

<p>We have data on software too. But that data has already been weaponized to purge people from tech.

<p>We need more people in tech, not less... empowered by tech and tech leadership.

<p>We should aim AI as a tool at building better leading, better learning,  and better people.

<p>From diet to health and nutrition to school, kids and elders alike benefit when we make people the point of learning, not machines.

<p>What the world needs now is better well-being.

<p>Humans who understand cash better than computers have tried to turn coders into human robots exactly as we've seen with HR, without their consent.

<p>Emotion matters as much in code as it did in empathy.

<p><strong>Why?</strong>

<p>Because software is <em>emotional communication</em> like music. Remove the emotion and you get music made with machines while we wait for the open-hearted part that Geddy Lee promised as he sung Neil Peart's lyric in 1980.

<p>The Greeks saw this at the Quadrivium, where they realized the connection between math and music.

<p>Emotion may be the only thing separating human consciousness from oversimplified machine intelligence found in AI and IQ. They share the same over-used word: <strong>intelligence</strong>.

<p>Eventually we'll realize the problem is dramatically deeper than AI or IQ. Hopefully, history will record our development of a lossy proxy like IQ to the age when we thought AI was the solution. Sigh.

<p>The consequences are obvious.

<h4>Actual Intelligence > artificial intelligence</h4>

<p>If we envision AI as tools instead of trauma, we may be the benefactors <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf">human:computer sensemaking revolution</a>,
who learn, grow, and thrive.

<p>Care, oversight, and structured interlocution are required from kids to elders.

<h4>Structured interlocution = teachable moments</h4>

<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care.
<h3>Cowboy Coworking Community</h3>
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought is alive and well from the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/facility-rental/studio/">Studio</a> in the basement at the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/">Carnegie Free Library and Music Hall</a> to the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/facility-rental/lincoln-gallery-rental/">Lincoln Gallery</a> on the second floor.
<p>The small forest of Red Oaks near the crest of the hill shades those who enjoy the cool, shaded space there when they seek shelter from the sun below.
<p>As the temperature rises and falls, one may find solace in cold teas and hot coffees below at <a href="https://www.carnegiecoffeecompany.com/">Carnegie Coffee</a> company - the former Carnegie Post Office..
The Lincoln Gallery stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.

  <p>I strive to be sentient, salient, and sanguine.</p>
  <p>I live to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias">WEIRD</a>, whimsical, and woolly.</p>
<p>I'm Happiest working on compute and software with communities, as opposed to cash and commerce. Preferably in peer:pairs.</p>
<p>Invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and cooperative learning games. Even in failure, we learn lessons from <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1191/">trying</a>, remember the immortal words of the Jedi prophet:
