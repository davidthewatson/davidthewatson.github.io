<h3>Feel, see, think; be, do, act</h3>

<p>Given teaching was my training, the didactic nature of it was apparent, or transparent, depending on your perspective.
<p>My startup journey breeched Burlington before the remoteness of Redmond brought the misty dream to a close. I miss Clam Chowder, Cannondale, and the Cascades.
<aside>Think about it.</aside>
<p>Modeling humans in software is easier now than modeling software in humans. Hence, the paradox.</p>

<p>That's exactly why we should be optimistic. We have data on people. The data we have on software is already being used to eliminate humans under the guise of optimization - the same trope we've eliminated troves of jobs with for a long time.

<p>Humans who understand cash over computers are trying to turn coders into human robots exactly as they did with HR. Emotion matters as much in code as it did in empathy. Emotion may be the only thing separating human consciousness from oversimplified machine intelligence found in AI and IQ. They share the same bad word: Intelligence. Eventually we'll realize the problem is dramatically deeper than AI or IQ. Hopefully, history will record our development of a lossy proxy like IQ to the age when we thought AI was the solution. Sigh.

<p>The consequences are obvious..

<h4>Actual Intelligence > artificial intelligence</h4>

<p>If we envision AI as tools instead of trauma, we may be the benefactors of the <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf">human:computer sensemaking revolution</a>,
where we learn, grow, and thrive.

<p>Care, oversight, and structured interlocution are required from kids to elders.

<h4>Structured interlocution = teachable moments</h4>

<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought is alive and well at the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/civil-war-room/the-lincoln-gallery/">Lincoln Gallery</a>. A beacon of light and learning which illuminates the Red Oaks all the way down to <a href="https://www.carnegiecoffeecompany.com/">Carnegie Coffee</a> community below.
The Lincoln Gallery stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.

  <p>I strive to be sentient, salient, and sanguine.</p>
  <p>I live to be <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychology#WEIRD_bias">WEIRD</a>, whimsical, and wondrous.</p>
<p>I'm Happiest working on compute and software with communities, as opposed to cash and commerce. Preferably in peer:pairs.</p>
<p>Invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and cooperative learning games. Even in failure, we learn lessons from <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1191/">trying</a>, remember the immortal words of the Jedi prophet:

  <p>Do or do not. There is no try.</p>
