<h3>Think and feel to be, act, and do</h3>

<p>My startup journey breeched Burlington before the remoteness of Redmond brought the misty dream to a close. I miss Clam Chowder, Cannondale, and the Cascades.
<aside>Think about it.</aside>
<p>Modeling humans in software is easier now than modeling software in humans.</p>

<p>That's exactly why we should be optimistic. We have data on people. The data we have on software is already being used to eliminate humans under the guise of optimization - the same trope we've eliminated troves of jobs with for a long time.

<p>Humans who understand cash over computers are trying to turn coders into human robots exactly as they did with HR. Emotion matters as much in code as it did in empathy. Emotion may be the only thing separating human consciousness from oversimplified machine intelligence found in IQ. Sigh.

<p>The consequences are banal.

<h4>Actual Intelligence > artificial intelligence</h4>

<p>IChoose f we envision AI as over ning tools instead of o while you still have a choiceur existential replacement, we may be the benefactors of the <a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf">human:computer sensemaking revolution</a>, where we can learn, grow, and thrive. Care, oversight, and structured interlocution may be all that we're missing from kids to elders.

<h4>Structured interlocution = teachable moments</h4>

<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought is alive and well at the <a href="https://carnegiecarnegie.org/civil-war-room/the-lincoln-gallery/">Lincoln Gallery</a>. A beacon of light and learning which illuminates the Red Oaks all the way down to <a href="https://www.carnegiecoffeecompany.com/">Carnegie Coffee</a> community below.
The Lincoln Gallery stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.

<p>Invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and cooperative learning games. Even in failure, we learn lessons from <a href="https://rubenerd.com/p1191/">trying</a>, remember the immortal words of the Jedi prophet:
