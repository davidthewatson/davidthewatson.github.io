<h3>while not(innovation(for insight in inquiry))</h3>
<p>A creative guy from Pittsburgh, Boston framed my East Coast journey straight outta  software startups. Sadly, the rainy wrath of El Nino in Seattle framed my big tech acquisition transition on the West Coast. Don't miss El Nino; do miss living in the foothills of the Cascades.
<p>People who value community over commerce need the scale that commerce has more naturally co-opted. People scale like pennies too, in powers of 2, they just need peer:pair social structure to scale nonlinearly.
<p>Invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and the cooperative care that keep them together. But that's only a given if our agility above the neck is matched by our rigidity in shipping below the neck. Balancing thinking and feeling is the challenge.
<p>People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to feel care - a point sadly lost on most of the tech community.
<p>People turn failure into success by remembering that software is a cooperative learning game.  Modeling people in software is now easier than modeling software in people. That's exactly why I'm optimystic for Tool AI. If we envision AI as the tool it is, where AI is Actual Intelligence, we may be the benefactors of the human:computer sensemaking union alive since peek and poke defined 1970-something. Care, oversight, and structured interlocution are key from kids to elders. Fortunately, structured interlocution contains teachable moments.
<p>I'm happiest building peer:pair communities from 2 guys-in-a-garage by sizing versus politicizing pizza teams.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought for the last decade is the Lincoln Library at Carnegie Library Music Hall in Carnegie, PA  a beacon of light illuminating the Oaks all the way down the hill to the former Post Office turned Carnegie Coffee community below.
<p>The Lincoln Library stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.
