<h3>AI models us better than we model software.</h3>
<article id="topmost">

<p>My name is Dave. I also answer to David and Watson.
<h3>Software <em>is</em> Emotional Communication</h3>
<p>I see software as another form of emotional communication, similar to music. Of course, this implies that software takes the design time and care to produce an emotional experience that resonates like Appalachian Spring. It also implies that, like music, software must be seen as a living, breathing, organic thing that doesn't settle. It has a cycle, despite the fact that google has tried hard to ensure that elderly software is still beta. Beta may be schizophrenic, like Lacan's patients in Paris.We've known the relationship between math and music since the quadrivium.

<p>But software's infinite extensibility makes it more than just one and done. Instead it breathes, lives, and grows, as if it were organic, but it is not. Hence, the need for human care, concern, and cooperation to make software breathe, learn, and grow just like humans.
<p>Music is where my education began. Where it will end no one knows. Life is learning.
<p>Kids don't retire. Why should adults?
<p>I believe learning if leading, AI is a tool, and if we succeedu, AI may be the tool that together with us, enables us to end disease, disorder, disability, and despair from birth to death across the human lifespan.

<p>That may seem ambitious but I'm not alone in that vision.

<p>The Greeks saw the connection between music and math at the Quadrivium.

<h4>Actual Intelligence > Artificial Intelligence</h4>

<p>We are poised to benefit from the greatest breakthrough in
<a href="https://www.efsa.europa.eu/sites/default/files/event/180918-conference/presentations/20-3_07_Pirolli.pdf">human:computer sensemaking</a>,

since BASIC gave us peek and poke in 1970-something.

<p>Care, oversight, and structured interlocution are required from kids to elders.

<h4>Structured interlocution = teachable moments</h4>

<p>People who value community over commerce may benefit from the scale that commerce more naturally provides.
People feel care in cooperation. People don't need cognition to care.
<h3>Libraries are C<sup>3</sup></h3>
<h3>WTH?</h3>
<h3>Cowboy Coworking Communities</h3>
<p>If you look at any great public library today, you'll see that kids, adults, and elders read, learn, grow, and thrive together helped by librarians and tech tools from Dewey Decimal to computers.
