<p>A creative guy from Pittsburgh, Boston framed my East Coast journey straight outta  software startups. Sadly, the rainy wrath of El Nino in Seattle framed my big tech acquisition transition on the West Coast. Don't miss El Nino; do miss living in the foothills of the Cascades, although the park behind <a href="https://www.redfin.com/PA/Pittsburgh/1314-Arrowood-Dr-15243/home/74560488">my house</a> mirrors the Cascades nicely.
<p>Love to chat with people who value community over commerce. Sadly, communities need the scale that commerce has more naturally co-opted. People scale like bits too, they just need peer:pair social structure to do it.
<p>Invisible ideas may take shape as usable products, scalable services, and cooperative care that keep them together. But that's only a given if our agility in creation above the neck is matched by our rigidity in shipping below the neck. Balancing thinking and feeling is the challenge.
<p>People feel cooperative care. They don't need cognition for that - a point sadly lost on most of the tech community.
<p>People turn failure into success by remembering that software is a cooperative learning game.  Modeling people in software is now easier than modeling software in people. That's exactly why I'm an optimist for AI. If we meet AI where it is with Actual Intelligence, we may be the benefactors of that human:computer sensemaking meeting. Care and oversight in communities use of AI from kids to elders is key.
<p>I'm happiest building peer:pair communities from 2 guys-in-a-garage by sizing versus politicizing pizza teams.
<p>The cowboy coworking community I've sought for the last decade is the Lincoln Library at Carnegie Library Music Hall in Carnegie, PA  a beacon of light illuminating the Oaks all the way down the hill to the former Post Office turned Carnegie Coffee community below.
<p>The Lincoln Library stands as a testament to Abe as the original coworker.
