<h4>My name is Watson, Dave Watson - a designer from Pittsburgh.
<p>I launched a music education program in college, a tech startup in the early aughts, and an AI coaching program emerging since resigning my role as senior member of technical staff at Carnegie Mellon University in 2020, after I read Max Tegmark.
<p>I love to chat with like-minded people who put community potential  above commercial profit.
<p>If you'd like to chat, reach out to me at my first name in two syllables at this domain. Happy to ZooMeeTeams. Happier to jump in my latest creation - a rally concept car I call the bamboo barchetta - a cross between nomadland and Mad Max: Fury Road. Happiest putting my mobile data center in a bag on a plane and meeting peer:paring in-person, as far as that scales: Pizza Teams.</html>
<h2>Peace, Dave</h2>
<h4>P.S. Caveat Emptor: I read STFU and several less iconoclastic, more astute, academic communication theory books a few years ago. I still cannot STFU despite years of effort. I'm sorry. I went to rehab for curiosity where I learned rehab is blaming the victim from cradle to grave. :-/
