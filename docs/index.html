<h4>Human-computer sensemaking is a learning loop with AI:</h4>
<h6>a cooperative learning game of inquiry, insight, and innovation - the terminal condition</h6>
<p>I'm a creative guy from Pittsburgh, where Boston and Seattle framed my journey from East coast software startups to West Coast big tech acquisitions.
<p>I love to chat with people who put community potential  above commercial profit.
I make invisible ideas take shape as usable products, scalable services, and cooperative community care that users can feel. I've turned failure into success by always remembering that software itself is a cooperative learning game.
<p>I took a turn toward more personal work from my  senior technical role at  Carnegie Mellon University in 2020, after I read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kai-Fu_Lee">Kai-Fu
Lee</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuart_J._Russell">Stuart
Russell</a>, and <a href="https://futureoflife.org/person/max-tegmark/">Max
  Tegmark</a> which made me realize that, unlike Carnegie, <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/assets/pdfs/cmufactsheet.pdf">my heart wasn't in the work</a>.


<p>My approach helps humans dwarf diabetes. Using AI, we support learning with a human:computer sensemaking system designed using <a href="https://www.llama.com/">Meta Llama Scout 4</a> and/or <a href="https://www.alien.club/">Alientelligence</a> most empathic models depending on the cadence and ModelFile requirements. Modeling human inner space is now more straightforward than modeling software systems in outer spce ever was. We needed the constraints of physics in software. What we got was schizophrenic software instead.

<p>I'm happiest scaling 2 guys-in-a-garage by synthesizing subtractive design from sizing
instead of politicizing pizza teams. The cowboy coworking community I've sought for years is the Lincoln Library at Carnegie Library Music Hall in Carnegie, PA  a beacon of light illuminates the Oaks all the way down the hill to the community below.
<p>Who knew Abe was the original coworker?
