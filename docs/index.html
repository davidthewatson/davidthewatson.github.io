are Conscious!</h1> <p>I discovered my love of fate in several book(s) I wrote but never published. My work is a cycle
of mind consisting of reading, writing, and running. <h2>Why?</h2> <p>About
two years ago, I realized that writing is straightforward. That's when I was
experimenting with OpenAI's API and realized that better outcomes were beyond
OpenAI, found in the LLLM world building and running your own models locally
with the network cable pulled or the wifi disconnected as if you were doing
some kind of cybersecurity work, strangely where my career began in the data
center nearby. but publishing is pointless, given that content is the new
medium as opposed to tech. That's wrong. <p>AI is the medium. AI is the message.
Whether we master the medium or the medium masters us remains to be seen.
<p>I'm cautiously optimystic. I always wanted to found a religion but it's
easier to model  people's personas in  inner space than it is is to get anyone
to believe anything. <p>I first focused on OpenAI. Slowly, I realized that I
could go a fast and furioous by moving fast, breaking things, and directing
my furiousness at the model cycle in meta. </p> <p>Currently, I use Scout 4,
Alien Intelligence, and Gemma as the basis for most of my work in llama.cpp or
Ollama. I'm an advocate for AI since I've spent years understanding that it's
not about cognition, it's about memory. <p>we may be compute-bound, but the
computation binding us is GPU-compute. You know, the one where we burn down
forests in Oregon before wondering why the exploding dot cloud of complexity
found in language does not scale linearly. <p>We'll see wicked disease problems
from Cancer to Covid to Diabetes fall in AI's wake. Predicting when is the
hard part. Ask Alan Turing, Herb Simon, or Alan Kay. We're still not there
yet. The great white hope is the Skinner box found in Reinforcement Learning.
<h3>The Rub: Animal Intelligence vs Actual Intelligence</h3> </p> <p> Theorp
realizations didn't stop there. When <a href="https://www.anilseth.com">Anil
Seth</a> first saw consciousness as transient hallucination, I believed
him. The key to me, is that Seth's insight  applies not just to humans
but animals as well. </p> <p> <h3>The Truth: Intelligence is a thin
slice of Consciousness.</h3> <p>Hence, we needed a consciousness quotient
(CQ).</p> <p>IQ is lossy. The untold damage done by the mere existence
of IQ is immeasurable.</p> </p> <p> Fortunately, we got that answer over
a decade ago from  a researcher named Ovidiu Brazdau, a Romanian who <a
href="https://scholar.google.ro/citations?view_op=list_works&hl=en&hl=en&user=p0KMp6IAAAAJ">wrote papers</a>, then
<a href="https://www.consciousness-quotient.com">founded an institute.</a> </p>

awareness make sense of complex context, conditions, and environment at once!
<p>Consciousness is complex.We tap screens to find facts lost and consensus
unfound. Canine gazes mask consensus. <p>Canines mix crazy fast concurrent
hallucinations into consciousness just like we do!</h2> <p>Does it really matter
whether dogs faces evoke Nietzsche, Bertrand Russell, or Grandma's white-bearded
stoic senex? <p>Is there a difference between canine consciousness and animal
intelligence? <p>Dogs know naturally what we think or feel liminally at the hazy
edges of consciousness.</p> </body><p class="notice">David is an idea cyclist from a tiny milltown mirror world ring of Pittsburgh.
