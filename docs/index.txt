Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
You'll find some of my writing on my essays page where I rant, rave, and ramble about all things diabetes, technology, and diabetes technology.
You'll also find my resume here in case you'd like to work with me.
Thanks for visiting!





Me and my Viszla are active outdoors where we play frisbee.
