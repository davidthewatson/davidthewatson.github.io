Welcome to davidwatson.org!
I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
You'll find my writing on the essays page where I rant, rave, and ramble about diabetes, technology, and diabetes technology.
If you'd like to work with me, see my  resume.
Thanks for visiting!
