Welcome to davidwatson.org...
I thrive on a repeating ritual of reading, writing, and reflection.

When I read, I read Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace.

When I write, I write on a variety of topics from diabetes to technology.

When I reflect, I reflect over trio jazz from Felix Lehrmann, Pat Metheny, and Marcin Wasilewski. 

I'm inspired by David Liddle, Denise Faustman, and Vince Lombardi.

Thanks for visiting!
