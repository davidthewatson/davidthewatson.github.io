Welcome to davidwatson.org...
I read, write, and reflect to grow, learn, and teach.
When I read, I find transcendence in Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace.

When I write, I shed light on a variety of topics from diabetes to technology.

When I reflect, I listen to trio jazz from Felix Lehrmann, Pat Metheny, and Marcin Wasilewski. 

I'm inspired by David Liddle, Greg Lemond, and Vince Lombardi.

Thanks for visiting!
