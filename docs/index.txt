Welcome to davidwatson.org...
I thrive on rituals of reading, writing, and running;  fasting, feasting, and reflecting. 

Among great thinkers, I admire Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace for their reading and writing.

Among great athletes, I admire Eliud Kipchoge, Rich Roll, and Zach Bitter for their running, fasting, and feasting.

Among great musicians, I admire Felix Lehrmann, Pat Metheny, and Marcin Wasilewski for their reflective trio jazz. 

Among great researchers, I'm inspired by David Liddle, Denise Faustman, and Seth Roberts.

Thanks for visiting!
