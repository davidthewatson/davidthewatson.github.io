Welcome to my little corner of the internet where I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.

You'll find some of my writing on my essays page where I rant, rave, and ramble about all things diabetes, technology, and diabetes technology.

You'll also find my resume here in case you'd like to work with me.

I am active outdoors: cycling, walking my Viszla, or doing the Maffetone shuffle also known as running.


Thanks for visiting!
