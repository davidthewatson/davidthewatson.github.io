I thrive on rituals... 

Reading, writing, and running
Fasting, feasting, and reflecting 
Learning, growing, and reminiscing
My life is enriched by imperfection...

Learning from living with diabetes
Helping in the struggle against chronic disease
Striving to be a beacon of light in a sea of darkness

thanks for visiting!
