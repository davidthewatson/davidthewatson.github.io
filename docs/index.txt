Welcome to davidwatson.org...
I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting.
When I'm reading, I find transcendence in Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace.

When I'm writing, I rant, rave, and ramble on a spectrum from diabetes to technology.

When I'm reflecting, I listen to esoteric trio jazz from Pat Metheny to Marcin Wasilewski. 

If you'd like to work with me, see my  resume.

Thanks for visiting!
