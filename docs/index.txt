I thrive on rituals of reading, writing, and running;  fasting, feasting, and reflecting. 

Among thinkers, I admire Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace.

Among athletes, I admire Eliud Kipchoge, Rich Roll, and Zach Bitter.

Among musicians, I admire Felix Lehrmann, Pat Metheny, and Marcin Wasilewski.

Among researchers, I admire David Liddle, Denise Faustman, and Seth Roberts.

Thanks for visiting!
