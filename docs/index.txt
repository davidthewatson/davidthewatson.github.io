Welcome to davidwatson.org...
I read, write, and reflect to learn, teach, and grow.
When I'm reading, I find transcendence in Byung-Chul Han, Alan Kay, and David Foster Wallace.

When I'm writing, I shed light on a variety of topics from diabetes to technology.

When I'm reflecting, I listen to trio jazz from Felix Lehrmann, Pat Metheny, and Marcin Wasilewski. 

If you'd like to work with me, see my  resume.

Thanks for visiting!
