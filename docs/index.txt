Welcome to my little corner of the internet!
I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
You'll find some of my writing on my essays page where I rant, rave, and ramble about all things diabetes, technology, and diabetes technology.
If you'd like to work with me, see my  resume.
Thanks for visiting!





Me and my Viszla are active outside doing the Maffetone shuffle.
