      <h2>Transcript</h2>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: hey everyone, welcome back for another deep dive with us. I'm excited for this one. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah, me too. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: And today is all about you, the listener, because uh well, you sent us this résumé. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. We're going to deep dive into David Watson's career journey based on this résumé that we got from one of our listeners. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Fantastic. And uh this isn't going to be just like a boring list of job titles and dates. We're going to dig deep. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Oh yeah. And uncover the hidden gems and the patterns that make this particular career path. So unique. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Uhhuh. So, uh, right off the bat, something that jumped out at me was that David won a computer science award, right, before he even went to music school. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. That's interesting, isn't it? I mean, talk about starting early. It's like he was hinting at his ability to bridge these two seemingly different worlds. You music and tech. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah. And then boom, that award leads to a programming internship. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Right. I'm sensing a pattern here already. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: I think you're right. Yeah. I think this early experience could be a sign of something that we're going to see as a theme throughout David's career. this knack for connecting things that at first glance seem totally unrelated. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. It's like he sees bridges where other people see walls. I like that. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Okay. So, let's fast forward a little bit. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. He lands a gig as a technologist at Wyvern. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>:  Mhm. What exactly does that even mean? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. In the real world, you know, it's definitely more than just writing code, although I'm sure that was a big part of it. That title often suggests someone who gets the bigger picture, someone who understands how technology impacts a business's bottom line and can make decisions based on that understanding. Okay. You know, strategic decisions. So, not just writing the code, but thinking about the strategy behind it. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Right. Exactly. When speaking of smart moves, he mentions updating a legacy codebase with a TypeScript stack and Docker Kubernetes deployment, which led to a 25% reduction in complexity. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Wow. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Can you break that down for us non- tech folks? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Sure. Imagine you have a really old clunky piece of software. Okay. And you need to make it faster, more efficient, and easier to maintain. That's essentially what David did. All right. TypeScript is a programming language that helps developers write cleaner, more reliable code, while Docker and Kubernetes are tools that streamline the process of deploying and managing software applications. So, it's like taking a vintage car and giving it a modern engine and a super smooth transmission. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Exactly. And this was back in 2022, a time when these technologies were rapidly gaining popularity. So, it shows that David was really on top of these trends and understood the importance of adopting these modern practices to improve efficiency. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: All right. Next up, things take a really interesting turn. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Okay. He does some freelance work prototyping a personal knowledge management concept. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Okay. Using GPT. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Wow. This sounds seriously ahead of its time. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. What exactly is personal knowledge management and how does AI fit into all of this? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Personal knowledge management is all about organizing and connecting your thoughts, ideas, and experiences in a way that helps you learn and grow more effectively. Think of it like building your own personal Wikipedia, okay? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: But supercharged by AI, right? In David's case, he was using GPT, which stands for generative pre-trained transformer to create a system that could personalize learning experiences based on your unique interests and goals. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: So, he was tapping into AI back in 2022. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. To create something that's still cutting edge today. That's pretty impressive. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Absolutely. Okay. Then we see him working with Caterpillar, not once, but twice. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Interesting. What do you think drew him back for round two? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Well, it could be a number of things. Caterpillar is known for working on some really complex engineering projects. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Oh, yeah. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>:  So, maybe he was drawn to the technical challenges. Or they also worked with some pretty advanced hardware like the ZCU 104 development board. Maybe that was a draw. Or perhaps it was just the company culture that resonated with him. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: I'm thinking maybe it was a combination of all those things. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah, probably. I mean, the work itself sounds pretty intense. Optimizing C++ code for a 20 to 40% performance improvement. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Wow, that's some next level stuff. It definitely shays a dope understanding of software engineering principles and the ability to squeeze every ounce of performance out of a system. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Right. And let's not forget his work on cloud native storage strategies. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Oh yeah. Back then a lot of companies were trying to figure out how to move their data to the cloud. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah. In a way that was secure, scalable, and cost-effective. It was a hot topic and David was right in the thick of it. Collaborating with IT executives to develop solutions. So, he's tackling these tough technical challenges. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. And working with leadership to shape the future of the company's infrastructure. That's a pretty powerful combination. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: It is. It highlights a really key skill that's often overlooked in the tech world. The ability to communicate complex technical concepts to non-technical audiences. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Oh, a good point. You can be the most brilliant coder in the world, but if you can't explain your ideas to the people who make decisions, you're not going to get very far, right? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Okay. Then comes Ren Jungle. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Okay, where things take a slightly different turn. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: All right. Suddenly, we see David leading weekly retros, focusing on team dynamics and implementing agile methods to improve collaboration. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Mhm. It's like a whole new skill set emerges. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: It is. This is where we start to see the people person side of David coming out. It's one thing to be a technical expert, but it's another thing entirely to be able to lead and inspire a team to create a culture of collaboration and continuous improvement. And let's not forget about that scrapy crawler he built over tour to navigate the real estate frontier undetected. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: That sounds like something straight out of a spy movie, right? It certainly speaks to his resourcefulness and creativity. You know, web scraping, which is essentially extracting data from websites, can be really tricky, especially when you're dealing with sites that have security measures in place. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah. By using a network that anonymizes your internet traffic. David was able to gather the data he needed without raising any red flags. It's a really clever solution that demonstrates his out of the box thinking. Okay, so we have the tech whiz. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Uhhuh. The AI innovator. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Uhhuh. C++ optimization guru. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. And now the team leader and web scraping ninja. He's got it all. What's next? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Well, next up is Wellbridge Health where David takes on a dual role as VP of product development and the IT compliance officer. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Seriously? VP of product development and adi compliance officer. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah, those feel like two completely different worlds. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: I know, right? It's an interesting combination. How does that even work? It makes me wonder if this was a deliberate move on David's part to gain experience in the business and legal side of technology, especially in the context of healthcare where compliance is so important. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Oh, yeah. It's like he's building a bridge between the technical world and the world of regulations and best practices. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: I see. And on the technical side, he mentions deprecating a legacy App Store dependency with a browser based Ember SPA MVP. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Okay. For those of us who aren't fluent in tech jargon, can you explain what that actually means. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Sure. So, an SPA or single page application is a type of web app that loads a single HTML page and dynamically updates the content as the user interacts with it. Think of it like a seamless interactive website that feels more like an app. Ember is a popular framework for building these SPA. Okay. So, in this case, he was replacing an older system that relied on a separate app downloaded from an app store with a more modern browser based solution. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Okay. Gotcha. So, it's like taking something that felt like dialup 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Uhhuh. and upgrading it to high-speed fiber optic internet. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Exactly. Faster, smoother, and just makes a lot more sense in today's world. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Right. And this move towards full stack development continues with his work at Forever where he built a prototype from Bootstrap to Heroku in a short time frame. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Nice. Can you break down what that means and why it's significant? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Full stack means that he's comfortable working on both the front end, what the user sees and interacts with, and the back end, the server side logic and database interactions that make the website work. Bootstrap is a popular framework for building the front end, while Heroku is a platform for deploying and managing web applications. Being able to build a prototype from start to finish in a short time frame shows that he's adaptable, resourceful, and comfortable wearing multiple hats, which are all essential skills in a fast-paced startup environment. So, he's not just a code monkey, he's a full-fledged web app architect who can handle everything from the foundation to the fancy finishes. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Exactly. And this ability to adapt and take on these different roles seems to be a recurring theme in his career. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: It really does. What do you think it is about David that allows him to move so seamlessly between these different areas of expertise? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Well, one thing that stands out to me is his willingness to constantly learn and expand his skill set, whether it's taking courses on Git, attending conferences like Pyon or even participating in MIT's independent activities period for RDBMS RDBI ah which is a fancy way of saying he was diving deep into database management systems. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Okay. He's always seeking out new knowledge and pushing himself beyond his comfort zone. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: It's like he has this insatiable curiosity. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. And this drive to never stop learning. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Exactly. And that's crucial for success in any field, but especially in technology where things are constantly evolving. You know, looking at all these different roles and projects, I'm starting to see this common thread running through David's career. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Okay. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: From writing SMS systems at Smash to leading technical teams at Wellspring and even managing UI development at Nomos. It seems like communication is at the heart of everything he does. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: You're absolutely right. It's like he's fascinated by the flow of information, whether it's between humans or machines. And he's not afraid to jump in and figure out how to make that communication more efficient, more effective, and more meaningful. So, what can you, our listener, take away from all of this? What's resonating with you so far about David's career path? Is it his uh fearlessness when it comes to embracing new challenges, you know, like AI, prototyping, or leading development teams. Or maybe it's his dedication to lifelong learning that's uh that's standing out to you. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: It's inspiring to see someone who's not just like a coding wiz, but also a master connector. He can lead teams. He can craft user interfaces and even build systems that communicate between machines. It's like he speaks both human and computer languages fluently. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: And let's not forget that early dive into AI and personalized learning back in 2022. It really highlights his forward thinking approach, you know, his ability to spot trends before they become mainstream. It's like he has this built-in radar for what's next and he's not afraid to experiment to push those boundaries. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Right. Speaking of pushing boundaries, let's talk about that senior member of technical staff role. Carnegie Mellon University's emerging technology center. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Right. The details are redacted, but it sounds pretty hush- hush. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah, it does, doesn't it? Working at the cutting edge of artificial intelligence, human computer interaction, and high performance computing. That's like a trifecta future of feels, right? We can only imagine what kind of groundbreaking projects he was involved in. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah, it's a bummer we don't have more details, but maybe that's part of the intrigue, right? It's like a secret chapter in his career full of possibilities. And who knows, maybe those experiences directly influenced his later work in AIdriven personal knowledge management. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah, that's a good point. It's fascinating to think about the connections. I'm noticing how each chapter in his career seems to build upon the previous one. It's not just like a series of random jobs, right? It's a carefully crafted journey of exploration and growth. It makes you wonder what's the common thread that ties it all together. What's the underlying motivation? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Well, if I had to guess, I'd say it's this relentless pursuit of progress. David seems to be constantly striving to improve things, to innovate, to find better solutions. Whether it's streamlining systems at Wyvern or pushing the boundaries of personalized learning with AI, there's this underlying drive to make things better. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: You know, that really resonates with me. I think a lot of us can relate to that desire to make a difference. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah. To leave our mark on the world. And it's inspiring to see someone like David actually living that out. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Absolutely. Turning those aspirations into concrete actions. You know, it's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day and lose sight of the bigger picture. But looking at someone like David reminds us that there are so many different ways to make an impact. It's about finding that sweet spot where your passions and your skills intersect and then going allin and 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Speaking of passions and skills, we haven't even touched on David's education. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Oh, that's right. He earned a bachelor of science in business administration from Dukane University, but his coursework included computer science, technical writing, and even music education. Talk about a well-rounded education. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: It's like that early hint of polymathy we saw with the computer science award before music schools coming full circle, right? He wasn't just interested in the technical side of things. He also understood the importance of communication, right? Whether it was through code writing or even music, he didn't stop there. He continued learning with courses at PyCon and even participated in MIT's IAP RDBMS. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: I have to admit I'm not familiar with RDBMS. Can you shed some light on that? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Sure. RDBMS stands for relational database management system. It's basically a way to organize data in a structured format using tables, rows, and columns. Think of it like a super organized spreadsheet on steroids. Uh So he was diving deep into the world of databases. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: He was. And why is that significant? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Well, databases are the backbone of almost every modern application. They store everything from customer information to financial transactions to social media posts. So understanding how to design, manage, and query databases is an essential skill for any aspiring technologist. So he's got this broad foundation in business communication and technology. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Yeah. And he's constantly adding new layers to that foundation through ongoing education and professional development. It's like he's building this incredible skill set brick by brick. And that's a key takeaway here, isn't it? 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Mhm. No matter where you are in your own career journey, right? There's always room to grow, to learn, to explore new areas, it's all about having that mindset of continuous learning and being willing to push yourself beyond your comfort zone. It makes you wonder what could you be learning right now that would open up new doors for you? What skills or knowledge could you acquire that would take your career to the next level? Think about your own path. passions and interests. What are you naturally curious about? What problems are you drawn to solving? Maybe it's learning a new programming language or mastering a design tool or even taking a course on public speaking. The possibilities are endless. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: They are. And the beauty of it is you don't have to have it all figured out right now. The journey itself is part of the adventure. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Yeah, exactly. It's about embracing the unknown, taking risks, and being open to new experiences. Who knows what amazing opportunities might be waiting around the corner. You might even end up with a résumé as diverse and impressive as David's. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Speaking of David's résumé, we've covered a lot of ground in this deep dive. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: We have. But before we move on, I want to leave you, our listener, with one final thought. As you reflect on David's career path, what resonates with you the most? What can you learn from his adaptability, his technical depth, and his focus on communication? Maybe you're inspired by his willingness to jump into new challenges like AI prototyping or leading development teams. Or perhaps you admire his commitment to lifelong learning, constantly expanding his skill set and embracing emerging technologies. Whatever it is that speaks to you, remember that your career journey is your own. It's a unique tapestry woven from your experiences, your passions, and your choices. And just like David's journey, yours might not follow a straight line. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: Right. There might be twists and turns, unexpected detours, and even some U-turns along the way. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Sukhareva</span>: Exactly. And that's okay. It's all part of the adventure. The key is to stay curious, stay adaptable, and never stop learning. And remember, you don't have to do it alone. There are tons of resources available to help you along the way. Online courses, mentors, professional organizations, and even podcasts like this one. 
</p>
<p><span style="font-weight:bold">Dabrowski</span>: That's right. We're all in this together. So, keep exploring, keep learning, and keep pushing yourself to grow. Who knows, maybe one day we'll be doing a deep dive into your career, marveling at your unique journey of growth, innovation, and impact.
