<h2>architecture and design of a digital resume</h2>
<h3>architecture</h3>
<p>
  The architecture of the resume linked above models the resume as an event-driven publishing pipeline
  where the writer produces a single HTML file input and the system outputs three files in response:
<ol>
  <li>Plain Text</li>
  <li>Responsive Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</li>
  <li>Portable Document Format (PDF)</li>
</ol>
<p>Producing three output formats solves the problem of scaling the content from mobile to desktop to print, making reading as simple as possible. A simple, single file change affects all of the content at once.</p>
<h3>staticjinja</h3>
<p>Jinja is the templating language for Python behind Flask. staticjinja takes the templating power of Jinja, where
  Flask targets dynamic web content like database backed web stacks, and re-purposes it for static content in batch mode
  - like jekyll but radically simpler while retaining much of the power that makes static site generators such force
  multipliers.</p>
<pre><code><xmp>
      
      <!doctype html>
      <html lang="en">
      
      <head>
        {% include 'partials/_head.html' %}
      </head>
      
      <body>
        {% include 'partials/_header.html' %}
        {% block body %}{% endblock %}
        {% include 'partials/_footer.html' %}
      
        {% block footer_js %}{% endblock %}
      </body>
      
      </html>      
      
</xmp></pre></code>
<h3>bash</h3>
<p>
  Bash provides the unix pipe for our code to go from user-contributed src to generated docs for publishing. There are
  four steps in the process:
<ol>
  <li>Run staticjinja taking input templates from src and generating HTML at docs.</li>
  <li>Run wkhtmltopdf taking a file at our (staging) web server and generating PDF.</li>
  <li>Run html2text taking HTML as input and generating markdown as output.</li>
  <li>Run a python script, taking markdown as input and generating plain text as output.</li>
</ol>
</p>
<pre><code>
      #!/usr/bin/env bash 
      staticjinja build --srcpath=src --outpath=docs
      wkhtmltopdf http://localhost:8000/index.html index.pdf
      html2text index.html >index.md
      python ./md2txt.py
     </code></pre>
<h3>python</h3>
<p>
  The python code just takes markdown as input, transforms the markdown to plain text using this patch from <a
    href="https://stackoverflow.com/a/54923798">stackoverflow</a>, and outputs plain text.
</p>
<pre><code>
    def main():
        md_file = open('index.md')
        txt = md_file.read()
        plain_txt = unmark(txt)
        n = open('index.txt', 'w')
        n.write(plain_txt)
    </code></pre>
</p>
<h3>design</h3>
<p>The presentation is simpflified by the use of a classless CSS framework called <a
   href="https://newcss.net/?ref=github_demo">new.css</a>, which makes achieving simple and clean output straightforward.</p>
   <p>I arrived at classless frameworks after years of working with bootstrap to achieve similar tasks, albeit with a ton of code, work, and bloat.</p>
   <p>Of course, what the term <em>classless</em> is getting at is that all of these CSS frameworks, much like the JS frameworks that acommpany them, end up permeating systems to the point where everyone has to be a designer, whether they like it or not.</p>
   <p>What CSS should really do is provide an abstraction, not a leaky abstraction. When CSS permeates every square inch of a web pages surface area that's what's happening. What classless CSS frameworks aspire to do is push down those style details, where they belong, in the back-end of the system, not the front-end.</p>
   <p>So if you look at a piece of HTML from my site, what you'll notice is not that there's a complete lack of CSS, but rather, the default CSS is so well-styled by the framework authors that no cascading style is necessary, even though it's readily available.</p>
<h3>summary</h3>
<p>Modeling the resume production problem this way has benefits for reader and writer.</p>
<p>The design takes advantage of an automated data pipeline built on Unix pipes so that the writer can focus on writing content.</p>
  <p>The beauty of a system like this is that it is simple and reliable, depending on common open source software and free cloud resources.</p>
  <p>You get the rich content flow of a modern dynamic Content Management System (CMS), except there is no database and no application server, just a file system and some event-driven glue code, so it doesn't take an IT team to support it.</p>
