Summary & Skills
Help teams design, develop, and deploy software. Work has ranged from desktop to data center, mobile to cloud, startups to research labs. Comfortable working alone, in pairs, or small teams; private or shared office; hybrid or remote, home or coworking space. Began working remotely in 1999 - lived in Seattle, worked in Boston.
Operating Systems & Programming Languages
Productive working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows -  since Unix-like, BSD and WSL2 are close enough, respectively.
Since 2005, worked mostly in Python, occasionally in C++ or Ruby. Prior to 2005 worked mostly in C++, occasionally in Perl, Python, or Ruby.
Containerization & Virtualization
Used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration stacks like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization products like VMWare since 2000. 
Databases & Methods
Used PostgreSQL since 2008 for its native support for structured and unstructured data and numerous extensions (Citus, PostGIS, JSONB) plus a wide variety of cloud deployments that make dev-prod parity straightforward.
Tailored agile based on a synthesis of research from Alistair Cockburn, Allen Holub, Bonnitta Roy, and Ron Westrum, where what matters is what works for the team, its culture and its unique idiosynchracies.
