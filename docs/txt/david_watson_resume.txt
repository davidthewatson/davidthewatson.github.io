David Watson david@davidwatson.org
Summary
I help teams design, develop, and deploy software. I'm comfortable working alone, in pairs, or groups establishing consensus among competing constraints.
My work has spanned desktop to data center and mobile to cloud in a variety of business domains from startups to small research labs. 
I've worked primarily in C++ and Python on Linux, Mac, and Windows. 
Using a variety of tools such as Docker, Kubernetes, and PostgreSQL provides teams with a common foundation for building software.
When I'm not working, I like to bike, run, and ski. I relax by reading, writing, and reflecting.
