Summary & Skills
Help teams design, develop, and deploy software. Work has ranged from desktop to data center, mobile to cloud, startups to research labs. Comfortabljkjke working alone, in pairs, or teams; private or shared office; hybrid or remote, home or coworking space. Began working remotely in 1999 - lived in Seattle, worked in Boston.
Operating Systems & Programming Languages
Productive working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Unix-like OS - Linux, MacOS (BSD) and Windows (WSL2) suffice.
Since 2005, worked mostly in Python, occasionally in C++ or Ruby. Prior to 2005 worked mostly in C++, occasionally in Perl, Python, or Ruby.
Containerization & Virtualization
Used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration stacks like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization products like VMWare since 2000. 
Databases & Methods
Used PostgreSQL for more than a decade for its support for structured data, unstructured data, and numerous added value extensions plus a wide variety of cloud container deployments that make dev-prod parity straightforward.
Used an agile style from ideas like agile as a sensemaking platform. Weekly product rhythm is established by decision-making (roadmap) Monday, touching base loosely mid-week, and sense-making (reflection) on Friday.
