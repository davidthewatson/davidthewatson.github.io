Summary
I help teams design, develop, and deploy commercial software. That software has spanned proprietary and open source approaches to content management systems, data center automation, enterprise software, and systems management. 
My teams have shipped products by starting with a process of defining, prototyping, and iterating followed by reflecting, automating, and evolving. I enjoy working with small teams on emergent technology stacks that cannot be fully understood without a multidisciplinary, sensemaking approach.
When I'm not working, I like to I like to be active, outside, with my dog. In 2021, I finished two 5Ks, one 10K, and a half-marathon - the latter of which I medaled in my age group. I'm a competive person.
