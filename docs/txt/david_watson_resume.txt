Summary & Skills
Help teams design, develop, and deploy software. Work has ranged from desktop to data center, mobile to cloud, startups to research labs. Comfortable working alone, in pairs or teams; private or shared office; hybrid or remote, home or coworking space. Began working remotely in 1999 - lived in Seattle, worked in Boston.
Operating Systems & Programming Languages
Productive working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Just need a Unix-like OS - Linux, MacOS (BSD) and Windows (WSL2) qualify.
Since 2005, worked mostly in Python, occasionally in C++ or Ruby. Prior to 2005 worked mostly in C++, occasionally in Perl, Python, or Ruby.
Containerization & Virtualization
Used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration stacks like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization products like VMWare since 2000. 
Databases & Methods
PostgreSQL has been my defacto database since I saw Michael Stonebraker speak at MIT a decade ago.
My teams have worked iteratively, from whiteboard sketch to provisional prototype, while reflecting on design, documenting, testing, shipping, and repeating the process weekly. The key is to recognize that automation works for efficient processes like CI/CD, but not for inefficient processes like reaching design or engineering consensus.
