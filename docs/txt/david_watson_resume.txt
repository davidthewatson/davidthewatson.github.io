Containerization & Virtualization
Used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration stacks like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization products like VMWare since 2000. 
Markup & Markdown
Prefer markdown, plain text, or markup for a variety of technical documentation, including this resume.
Databases & Methods
Used PostgreSQL since 2008 for its native support for structured and unstructured data and numerous extensions (Citus, PostGIS, JSONB) plus a wide variety of cloud deployments that make&nbsp;&nbsp;dev-prod parity straightforward.
Tailored agile based on a synthesis of research from Alistair Cockburn, Allen Holub, Bonnitta Roy, and Ron Westrum, where what matters is what works for the team, its culture and its unique idiosynchracies.
