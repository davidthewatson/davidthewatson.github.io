Okay. So, uh, today we're going to be looking at the career of David Neil Watson. And wow, um, this CV, this CV is something else. I mean, this guy has done it all. Musician, computer scientist, AI developer. It's like he took the concept of a multi-hy career and just like, I don't know, cranked it up to 11 or something.

So, where do we even begin?

Hm. Well, you know what struck me first? It wasn't even the length of the CV really, but it was this statement right at the beginning. realizing empathy. It's just such an interesting mission statement, especially for somebody with like such a technical background, you know.

Yeah. No, you're totally right. That is a fascinating detail. It's almost like um a little bit of foreshadowing like, "Hey, get ready because this tech journey we're about to go on, it's going to be surprisingly human."

Exactly. And you know, it makes me wonder how does empathy actually like play out in a career that spans like everything from music education to like optimizing terrain visualization software. It's a big question.

Yeah, it is. A good oldfashioned detective mission through CV. All right. Well, let's uh let's start at the very beginning then. We see him at Dane University and already it's interesting because he's not just like a computer science student. He's also got music education

and technical writing on his plate, too.

And I think that right there is like our first clue. You know, this willingness to embrace what seem like totally unrelated fields really suggests that we're dealing with someone who's not just interested in the technical stuff, but also in communication, expression, and and understanding different perspectives, too.

Yeah. So, even before we get to like his actual work experience, we're seeing these little hints of a mind that's just wired for connection.

Precisely. And it makes me think that maybe even his early work in music, it wasn't just like a side passion or something, but actually something that fundamentally shaped his approach to problem solving.

Okay, I'm hooked. I'm ready to keep going. So, he finishes his education, wins a computer science award,

and lands an internship all before he even graduates. This guy clearly knows how to hit the ground running. Then we see him at Maya Design. He's diving head first into Python Web Services

and even doing a Ziggby IoT demo for Philips executives.

And don't forget this is the mid2000s. Like we're not talking about IoT being a buzzword yet. This is when it's still relatively niche technology. So he's working on this stuff when it's still really new.

Wow. So not only is he technically skilled, but he's also got like an eye for what's coming next. You know, he's ahead of the curve. But uh let's not forget about that empathy thread. How does that come into play at NYA?

H well I think if you look at the clients that he's working with there A+ schools human serviceservices.net these are organizations with very clear social missions and I think that suggests that you know he's not just building tech for the sake of tech but he's also thinking about the impact on real people.

Well it's a really good catch. Yeah. You know it's easy to get lost in the code sometimes and just totally forget about the bigger picture. Yeah. But it seems like he's already thinking about that human element pretty early on.

Okay. Next stop. on the CV Nomos. Now, this one is very intriguing to me because it's a jump into the world of FDA regulated medical software. Talk about high stakes.

Oh, yeah. No kidding. And I think this is really where that empathy idea from his statement starts to resonate even more. You know, building software that could directly impact people's health and well-being requires a whole other level of sensitivity and understanding. It's not just about meeting technical specks anymore. It's about potentially like affecting lives. You're totally right. It's a huge amount of responsibility way beyond just writing code

for sure.

And you can kind of see that same thread continuing at Wellspring where he led teams through like a major transition moving from traditional data centers

to a sauce model,

the cloud, a technological shift that everybody loves to talk about,

right? But what's interesting here is that it wasn't just about the technology itself. It was about bringing people along on that journey as well.

And that's where I think empathy becomes like a really critical leadership skill because leading a team through Major change requires that you understand their concerns, their fears, and their potential resistance to the change, too. It's about more than just telling people what to do. You know, it's about building trust and creating buy in.

Okay. So, we're starting to see a pattern here. New technologies, different industries,

but always with that underlying focus on the human side of the equation. All right. What comes next in this fascinating tech odyssey?

Well, next we have Smash. And this is where he's building conversational tech systems. Like, this is preeri pre-elect. even pre- chatbot boom.

Whoa. So, he's ahead of the curve yet again.

But how does empathy fit into this way? I mean, he's essentially building like the precursors to robots that talk to us.

Well, think about it this way. What makes a conversational system successful? It's the ability to understand and respond to human language and intent. It's about making technology feel more intuitive and more accessible.

That's a really interesting way to think about it. So, even in this seemingly very tech realm. He's still focused on bridging that gap between humans and machines.

Exactly. And that focus on user experience on making technology more human- centered. It's such a crucial element of design that I think often gets overlooked.

Okay, I'm officially seeing realizing empathy everywhere now. Can't wait to see how this all plays out in the latter part of his career. But, uh, I think we need to pause here for a second and let our listener catch their breath.

We've covered a lot of ground and there's still so much more to explore. Okay, so we're back on the trail. of David Neil Watson's career and so far it's been quite an adventure. We keep seeing that realizing empathy idea popping up in these unexpected places like his early studies or that ZigGB IoT work.

Yeah, it really is like he's approaching every single challenge with this question in his mind like how can I make this more human?

And I think that brings us perfectly to the next chapter. Caterpillar.

Caterpillar. Okay. Big machines, heavy equipment.

Not exactly the first thing I think of when I hear empathy. So I'm really curious about this one. So at Caterpillar, he's tasked with optimizing terrain visualization software, which means he's dealing with Kubernetes, S3, all that cloud infrastructure stuff. And at first, you might think, okay, well, that's hardcore tech. Where's the human connection there,

right? Yeah, I'm not seeing the empathy angle yet either. It seems like it's all about algorithms and data at this point.

But think about it. Even the most complex systems

are ultimately designed to serve human needs. And in this case, we're talking about software that helps people visualize and understand understand the terrain which could be used for anything from construction projects to disaster relief efforts.

Ah okay. So there's the bigger picture. He's not just optimizing code. He's optimizing the tools that people are using to make really important decisions.

Exactly.

And you know when you think about it that way the need for empathy becomes even more apparent. Imagine you know a construction crew is relying on this software to plan a safe and efficient excavation or a disaster relief team using it. to navigate like a really challenging landscape. The accuracy and the usability of that software could have realworld consequences.

Wow. Yeah, I hadn't thought about it like that. So, even when he's like deep in the technical weeds, he's still keeping that human impact in mind.

It seems like it.

Okay. It's really interesting.

And we see this attention to detail again and like the end users experience in his freelance work where he's prototyping PKM systems using GPT and AI.

Oh, yeah. This is the part that really caught my eye because on the surface it seems like such a left turn. You know, we go from heavy machinery to personal knowledge management. It's like he took a sharp right turn onto a totally different path.

Yeah, it is a shift for sure, but maybe not as drastic as it seems. You know, remember that phrase from his CV, realizing empathy. Well, what's more personal, more human than the way we organize and process our own thoughts and ideas?

You're right. It's about understanding how our minds work. But hold on a second. Isn't using AI for personal knowledge management, I don't know, a little ironic. I mean, to be about human intuition and connection and not algorithms.

That's a great question and it gets to the heart of like this whole debate that's been raging in the AI world for years. Can technology actually replicate or even enhance human empathy?

It's like is he using AI to help us be more human? Or is he risking letting the algorithms take over our thinking?

Well, I don't think it has to be either. You know, maybe it's about finding the right balance, using AI as a tool to amplify our own abilities, not replace replace them and maybe that's exactly what Watson's exploring in this PKM work.

Very interesting. A lot to think about there for sure. Okay, so after this freelance detour, he lands back in the corporate world at Wyvern. What's he tackling there?

Well, at Wyvern, he's roadmapping legacy code deprecation using Docker, Kubernetes, TypeScript. It's the kind of work that might not sound super glamorous, but it's absolutely essential for any company with aging systems.

Yeah. Dealing with legacy code. It's like the tech equivalent of cleaning out your attic. So where's the empathy in all of this?

Well, I think you have to consider the frustration and confusion that can come up when teams are forced to work with systems that are outdated or imagine the potential risks if those systems fail. Approaching this type of work with empathy means understanding the challenges faced by both the developers and the end users who rely on those systems every day.

Right? So it's about making that transition as smooth and painless as possible, minimizing disruption

and acknowledging those very real human anxieties

that come with these big technological changes.

Exactly. And I think it's a testament to Watson's ability to connect with people that he's been so successful in all these different roles from leading teams to optimizing algorithms. He's got this really unique blend of technical brilliance and human understanding.

Okay. Well, we've reached the end of this incredible CV journey and honestly, I'm feeling a little overwhelmed by all this information, but in a good way. Like my brain just got a serious workout. So, help me connect the dots here. What's the big takeaway? What does David Neil Watson's career tell us about navigating the modern workplace?

Well, I think the first lesson is that career paths are rarely linear. It's totally okay to be a multi-hyphenate, to embrace your diverse interests and be open to those opportunities that you maybe weren't expecting.

So, don't be afraid to like zigg and zag a little bit. Right.

Exactly. And second, I think his career is a great example of the power of transferable skills. transferable skills. Yeah, I like that. Like he's taken the things he learned in music, in communication, in leadership, and kind of woven all that into his technical work.

Exactly. And I think it shows that what you learn in one context can be super valuable in another. So don't underestimate those unique experiences you have.

Right. Okay. That's two solid takeaways for sure. But I feel like there's something even bigger here, though. Something that ties everything together. And I think it goes all the way back to that realizing empathy statement.

Yeah, you're totally right. I think the most important lesson here is that technical skills by themselves aren't enough, especially in a world that's becoming, you know, increasingly driven by technology. It's the human element that makes the difference.

So, it's not just about what you can build, but who you're building it for and how it actually impacts their lives.

Exactly. And all of that requires empathy, like the ability to understand and connect with people, to anticipate their needs, and to design solutions that actually make their lives better.

It's funny, you know, We started this deep dive thinking we were just going to analyze a tech career, but we ended up having this whole conversation about the importance of human connection.

It's true. It's like a reminder that no matter how advanced our technology gets, it's still the human heart that drives innovation and progress.

That's a beautiful way to put it. So to our listener out there who might be feeling a little lost in their own career journey right now, remember this. Cultivate your empathy. It'll make you a better engineer, a better leader, honestly, just a better human being.

And who knows? Maybe someday you'll have a career just as fascinating and impactful as David Neil Watson's.

All right. Well, before we wrap up, I have one more question. Throughout this whole deep dive, I kept wondering this. Do you think it's even possible to fully realize empathy in a world that's becoming more and more reliant on technology?

That is the question, isn't it? It's a question that deserves its own deep dive. I think it really gets to the heart of the challenge we're facing, like how we make sure that human connection doesn't get lost in all this technological progress.

And maybe, just maybe, by looking at careers like David Neil Watson's,

we can start to find some answers.

It's certainly given us a lot to think about.

It really has.

Well, this been a pleasure exploring this fascinating career with you.

Likewise. And to our listener out there, thank you so much for joining us on this deep dive. We hope you found it insightful and thoughtprovoking. Until next time, keep learning, keep growing, and most importantly, keep connecting.
