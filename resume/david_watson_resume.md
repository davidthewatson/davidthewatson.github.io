## Summary

I help teams design, develop, and deploy software. I've evolved the process from years of proprietary and open source work in R&D labs and startups from data centers to cloud native. 

My teams have shipped products by defining, designing, and reflecting, then iterating, evolving, and automating until shipping a complete product begins the product lifecycle anew. 

I enjoy working with small, peer teams on emergent technology whose organic complexity is high enough that the team's role is to reduce synthetic complexity through design.
