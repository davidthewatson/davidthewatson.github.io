### Summary and Skills

I help teams design, develop, and deploy software. My work has ranged from desktop to data center, mobile to cloud, and startups to research labs. I'm comfortable working alone, in pairs, or in teams; private or shared office; hybrid or remote, home or coworking space. I began working remotely in 1999, from Boston to Seattle.

#### Operating Systems and Programming Languages

I'm productive working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. I just need a Unix-like OS - Linux, MacOS (BSD) and Windows (WSL2) qualify. 

Since 2005, I've worked primarily in Python, secondarily in C++. Prior to 2005 I've worked primarily in C++, secondarily in Python.

#### Containerization and Virtualization

I've used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration tools like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization tools like VMWare since 2000. 

#### Databases and Methods

PostgreSQL has been my goto database environment since 2010, since it has managed both structured and unstructured data for years.

I work in an iterative style, from napkin sketch to provisional prototype, reflecting on design and engineering, shipping, and repeating the process.
