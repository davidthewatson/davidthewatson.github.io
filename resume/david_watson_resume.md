### Summary & Skills

Help teams design, develop, and deploy software. Work has ranged from desktop to data center, mobile to cloud, startups to research labs. Comfortable working alone, in pairs, or teams; private or shared office; hybrid or remote, home or coworking space. Began working remotely in 1999 - lived in Seattle, worked in Boston.

#### Operating Systems & Programming Languages

Productive working on Linux, MacOS, and Windows. Unix-like OS - Linux, MacOS (BSD) and Windows (WSL2) suffice.

Since 2005, worked mostly in Python, occasionally in C++ or Ruby. Prior to 2005 worked mostly in C++, occasionally in Perl, Python, or Ruby.

#### Containerization & Virtualization

Used containerization tools like Docker since 2015, Orchestration stacks like Kubernetes since 2017, and virtualization products like VMWare since 2000. 

#### Databases & Methods

Used PostgreSQL for more than a decade for its support for structured data, unstructured data, and numerous added value extensions plus a wide variety of cloud container deployments that make dev-prod parity straightforward.

Tailored agile from a synthesis of ideas like [agile as a sensemaking platform](https://medium.com/agile-sensemaking/why-sensemaking-will-save-agile-e1ad99b4805a) where weekly product rhythm is established by planning Monday, product touch-point mid-week, and sense-making Friday.
