### Shared Philosophy of Art and Science

Alan Kay, Donald Knuth, and Michael Stonebraker are three computer scientists who have made significant contributions to both art and science. They share a number of philosophical bases, including:

* The importance of creativity and innovation: All three scientists believe that creativity and innovation are essential to both art and science. They believe that the best way to make progress is to experiment and try new things, even if they seem crazy at first.

* The importance of beauty and simplicity: All three scientists believe that beauty and simplicity are important qualities of both art and science. They believe that the best solutions are often the simplest and most elegant ones.

* The importance of communication and collaboration: All three scientists believe that communication and collaboration are essential to both art and science. They believe that the best ideas come from sharing and discussing ideas with others.

* The importance of giving back to the community: All three scientists believe that it is important to give back to the community. They have all made significant contributions to open source software and other initiatives that benefit the wider community.

Here are some specific examples of how these philosophical bases are reflected in the work of Kay, Knuth, and Stonebraker:

* Alan Kay is known for his work on object-oriented programming and graphical user interfaces. He has said that his goal is to create "a world where children can grow up to be artists." This reflects his belief in the importance of creativity and innovation.

* Donald Knuth is known for his work on the TeX typesetting system and the Art of Computer Programming book series. He has said that his goal is to "write a book that will make the world a better place." This reflects his belief in the importance of beauty, simplicity, and communication.

* Michael Stonebraker is known for his work on database systems, including Ingres and PostgreSQL. He has said that his goal is to "make databases accessible to everyone." This reflects his belief in the importance of giving back to the community.

In conclusion, Alan Kay, Donald Knuth, and Michael Stonebraker are three computer scientists who share a number of philosophical bases, including the importance of creativity, innovation, beauty, simplicity, communication, collaboration, and giving back to the community. These philosophical bases are reflected in their work on art, science, and technology.
