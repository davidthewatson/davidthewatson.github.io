### Liminality of Transitioning to Sensemaking Culture

Liminal experience of communitas in groups transitioning from an unmanaged state into a culture of sensemaking is a powerful process that can help to create a shared sense of identity, purpose, and direction.

Liminality is a state of being "betwixt and between" social states. It is a time of transition and uncertainty, when old roles and structures are shed and new ones are not yet in place. This can be a disorienting and even frightening experience, but it can also be a time of great opportunity and growth.

Communitas is a feeling of solidarity and camaraderie that arises among people who are sharing a liminal experience. It is a sense of being in it together, of facing the same challenges and working towards the same goals.

In groups that are transitioning from an unmanaged state into a culture of sensemaking, the liminal experience of communitas can be especially powerful. This is because the group is collectively moving from a state of uncertainty and chaos to a new state of order and meaning. During this transition, the group members are all sharing a common experience, and they are all working towards the same goal: to create a new culture of sensemaking.

The liminal experience of communitas can help to create a strong sense of bonding among the group members. This is because they are all going through the same thing together, and they are all supporting each other through the process. The sense of communitas can also help to create a shared sense of identity and purpose. The group members come to see themselves as part of a community that is working together to create something new and important.

In order for the liminal experience of communitas to lead to a successful transition to a culture of sensemaking, it is important for the group to have a clear vision of the new culture they want to create. The group members also need to be willing to let go of old roles and structures, and to embrace new ways of working and thinking.

Here are some examples of how the liminal experience of communitas can play out in groups transitioning to a culture of sensemaking:

A group of new employees at a startup company may experience communitas as they come together to learn about the company's culture and values, and to develop new ways of working together.

A team of engineers working on a new product may experience communitas as they face challenges and setbacks together, and as they work towards the common goal of bringing the product to market.

A group of students in a new class may experience communitas as they bond over their shared experiences of learning and growing together.

In all of these cases, the liminal experience of communitas can help to create a strong sense of community and shared purpose, which can be essential for success in transitioning to a new culture of sensemaking.
