### Less is more: why two wheels are better than four

> Riding certainly is not for everyone, but no one can deny the city, experienced sitting on the back of a motorbike, is a different place. You are aware your body is tilting with the ground under it when you go up and down hills. You feel the weather and you see the people on the street around you. It puts you in touch with your community in a way more akin to walking or bicycling.
