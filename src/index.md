<h3>Welcome to davidwatson.org!</h3>
<p>I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
<p>You'll find my writing on the <a href="/essays/">essays</a> page where I rant, rave, and ramble about diabetes, technology, and <em>diabetes technology</em>.
<p>If you'd like to work with me, see my  <a href="/resume/">resume</a>.
<h3>Thanks for visiting!</h3>
