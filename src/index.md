<h3>Welcome to my little corner of the internet!</h3>
<p>I like to relax by reading, writing, and reflecting - learning is my happy place.
<p>You'll find some of my writing on my <a href="/essays/">essays</a> page where I rant, rave, and ramble about all things diabetes, technology, and <em>diabetes technology</em>.
<p>You'll also find my <a href="/resume/">resume</a> here in case you'd like to work with me.
<h4>Thanks for visiting!</h4>
