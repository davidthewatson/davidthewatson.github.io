<h3>Using Lean to Master Diabetes</h3>
<p>My background in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_startup">lean startups</a> has taught me to use feedback loops to build, measure, and learn. 
<p>I've borrowed a page from the playbook of my professional life and used it to optimize my personal life. Specifically: diet, exercise, and insulin.
<p>The minimum viable product (MVP) is a healthy diabetic (me), the iteration cadence is weekly, the measurements are wearable device data such as <a href="https://glancewatchface.com/">fitbit</a>, <a href="https://www.rouleur.cc/blogs/rouleur-performance/the-game-changer-continuous-glucose-monitoring">continuous glucose monitor</a> (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_glucose_monitor">CGM</a>), and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulin_pump">insulin pump</a>. The result is data-driven, progress is clear, and goals are achieved. 

<p>We get <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Roberts#Self-experimentation">correlation</a>, while causation requires <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertain_data">less uncertain data</a> with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:The_5V_model_that_currently_defines_Big_Data.png">improved velocity and veracity</a>. 
<p>We need the weakest link in the chain - <a href="https://mdpi-res.com/d_attachment/sensors/sensors-10-10936/article_deploy/sensors-10-10936.pdf?version=1403313543">the CGM sensors that use subcutaneous interstitial fluid</a> - to be more granular and more accurate during both sleep and exercise - both events where hypo- and hyper-glycemia are high risk and potentially damaging in acute and long-term settings.
