<p>I ran the Pittsburgh Marathon in May 2022 with all of these devices on my person. I began the race with BG of 162 and ended the race with BG of 74.
<p>To me, those numbers are a remarkable testament to what's possible with these devices, even given their risks detailed below.
<p>I finshed my first, and likely only marathon, as a type 1 diabetic since childhood, with blood glucose completely in normal range during the duration of the race, while running at a pace that was so slow, it's at the 94th percentile of all marathon finishers for my age. 
<p>I consider that a success while <a href="https://www.wpxi.com/news/local/allegheny-county/30000-runners-brave-soggy-weather-pittsburgh-marathon/OXIUOECXDRHJNAHE7U4OMP6URQ/">blaming it on the weather</a>. 
<p>My guess is that each shoe had an extra half pound of water throughout the race since there were at least 3 major storms with thunder, lightning, and heave downpours while I was running. The sun never shines on Pittsburgh.
