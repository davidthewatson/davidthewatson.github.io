When I worked at MAYA Design, the quote under my bio was taken from Terry Winograd's book, "Bringing Design to Software".

In Chapter 2, David Liddle was quoted: "Software design is the act of determining the user’s experience with a piece of software. It has nothing to do with how the code works inside, or how big or small the code is. The designer's task is to specify completely and unambiguously the user’s whole experience.... The most important thing to design properly is the user's conceptual model. Everything else should be subordinated to making that model clear, obvious, and substantial. That is almost exactly the opposite of how most software is designed."

Jorge Arango's Ontological Debt is the most clear, obvious, and substantial statement on ontology I've read. The author explains much more than the transactional frame of "technological debt" or tech debt.

Given Arango's definition of Ontological Debt and my interest in hauntology, it becomes clear that many organizations are haunted by ontological ghosts across the product lifecycle.

Ontological debt serves as a cultural symbol of entire eras inside and outside a product organization from design to use. When successful product markets scale beyond projections, ontological debt lingers and haunts from beyond the product's lifecycle. 

Exemplars abound.

Added to my short list which includes Peter Pirolli and Bret Victor.

Special thanks to Jared Spool for sharing Arango's work.
