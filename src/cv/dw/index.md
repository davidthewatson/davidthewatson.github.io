### Objective

Craft complete products & services with creative people bound by protean culture, minimal methods, and modern tools.

### Summary

Startups taught me to value the implied constraints of small teams that scale to envision, prototype, redesign, refactor, and ship software on a cloud conveyor belt. Studies yielded a merit award, an internship, and ultimately a fellowship. 

### Skills

**Development**: Tech contributor roles. R&D Labs & startups. Designed, developed & documented DB/API/GUI/WWW.  

**Operations**: Hands-on tech lead roles. Early-stage startups. Agile, Builds, CI/CD & DevOps tools, containers & cloud.

**Management**: Leadership roles. Late stage startups and R&D labs. Led teams to iteratively improve SDLC methods.
