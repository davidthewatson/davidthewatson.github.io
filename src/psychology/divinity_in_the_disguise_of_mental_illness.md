### Divinity in the Disguise of Mental Illness in William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury

> Faulkner needed Benjy in order to tell the world that the man-made constructs that we persist in subscribing to day after day and generation after generation are just figments of our imaginations. But to the metahuman, those who are more tapped into their brain’s power and thus functioning on a level closer to a god’s, these constructs are meaningless. They have no point to them, just like they have no point to a child. Children and Benjy tell time by the beauty of the sky, while we are all left to the devices of our ticking clocks.
