### Filial Apocrypha

I define filial apocrypha as a time when communication between parent and child are severed.

The gap that opens up between the parent-child is writ large whether epistemic or epistemological.

Intentional or not, the severance of filial communication is tragic. 

The severance of that sacred communication has bidirectional effects for both parent and child.

For the parent, those effects may take on the form of loss, shame, and-or guilt.

For the child, those effects may take on the form of fear, anxiety, solitary play, or the latchkey kid syndrome.

Regardless, the effects of apocrypha are as old as the bible and in some cases, like familes, just as damaging to cultural preserverance or survival of agency and meaning.
