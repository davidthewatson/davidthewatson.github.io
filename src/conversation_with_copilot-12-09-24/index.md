**User:** what's the linux cli way to shrink jpg for web

**Assistant:** The default settings for `jpegoptim` and `optipng` do not guarantee a specific file size, such as less than 1 MB per image. Instead, they apply optimization techniques to reduce the file size as much as possible without significantly affecting image quality.

### jpegoptim Default Settings:
- **Lossless Compression**: By default, `jpegoptim` performs lossless compression, which reduces file size without altering visual quality.
- **No Specific Size Guarantee**: There is no default setting that guarantees a file size of less than 1 MB.

### optipng Default Settings:
- **Lossless Compression**: `optipng` also performs lossless compression by default, optimizing PNG files without losing quality.
- **No Specific Size Guarantee**: Similar to `jpegoptim`, there is no default setting that ensures a file size of less than 1 MB.

If you need to achieve a specific file size, you can use the `-s` option in `jpegoptim` to set a target size (e.g., `-s 1m` for 1 MB) or adjust the optimization level in `optipng` with the `-o` option (e.g., `-o7` for the highest compression).

Would you like more details on how to set specific file size targets?

**User:** nothing you described actually works: "jpegoptim -s 500 KB ~/Downloads/IMG_2053.jpg jpegoptim: file not found: 500 jpegoptim: file not found: KB /Users/watson/Downloads/IMG_2053.jpg 4032x3024 24bit N [OK] 2970324 --> 2970324 bytes (0.00%), skipped."

**Assistant:** I apologize for the confusion. It looks like the `jpegoptim` command I suggested doesn't support a direct file size target. Let's use another method to shrink the file size on disk.

### Solution with `jpegoptim` and `mogrify`

1. **Install ImageMagick and jpegoptim**:
    ```sh
    sudo apt-get install imagemagick jpegoptim
    ```

2. **Optimize the Image**:
    Use `jpegoptim` to reduce the quality and make the file size smaller:

    ```sh
    jpegoptim --max=80 ~/Downloads/IMG_2053.jpg
    ```

    This command reduces the quality to 80%, which should shrink the file size without significant loss in visual quality.

3. **Further Compression** with `mogrify`:
    Use `mogrify` from ImageMagick to resize the image:

    ```sh
    mogrify -resize 1920x1080 ~/Downloads/IMG_2053.jpg
    ```

    This command resizes the image to a resolution of 1920x1080, which should also help reduce the file size.

4. **Check the File Size**:
    Ensure the resulting file size meets your requirements. If not, you can adjust the parameters in the commands above (e.g., reducing the quality further or resizing to a smaller resolution).

### Script for Batch Processing

If you want to batch process multiple images, here's a script that combines the steps:

```sh
#!/bin/bash

for file in ~/Downloads/*.jpg; do
    echo "Processing $file"
    jpegoptim --max=80 "$file"
    mogrify -resize 1920x1080 "$file"
done
