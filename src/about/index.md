##### About Dave
<p><img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/watson.png" alt="Dave" title="Dave"></img> </p>

I've lived in Boston and Seattle, but *here* is [Pittsburgh](/philosophy/between_buddhism_middle_way_and_japanese_ma.html) - an Appalachian  rust-belt reflection of what once was great between the [128 beltway](https://bankerandtradesman.com/on-route-128-a-history-of-constant-innovation/) and [Silicon Valley](https://techcrunch.com/2009/10/31/the-valley-of-my-dreams-why-silicon-valley-left-bostons-route-128-in-the-dust/). Pittsburgh is the place where, like New England and the Pacific Northwest, the [arts, sciences, and education](https://profpeaton.com/2015/09/13/starting-with-dewey-education-as-science-or-art/#:~:text=Education%20is%20not%20either%20an%20art%20or%20a,%E2%80%9Csciences%E2%80%9D%20that%20impact%20our%20systematic%20understanding%20of%20education) transcend a history of collaborative innovation. I've learned and grown from that history while enjoying the nature they share. 
My life has been divided among 3 things:

[Staring into screens may seem like human nature](https://www.fairobserver.com/more/science/screen-addiction-technology-news-overusing-computer-screens-science-news-38012/), but I prefer to be outside hiking, biking, and running. I've discovered that, from Shorthairs to Weimaraners to Vizslas, pointers have a way of making 
a hyperactive feel lazy. Like a nomad, I'm always on the run. From what, I'm not exactly sure. The rolling stone gathers no moss.

My teenage adulation of [Breaking Away](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/breaking-away-was-this-actors-breakout-role-
fans-say-it-changed-their-lives-too) ended with a spectacular bike
crash. Slow jogging long distances has taught me that [the race is not always to the swift](https://read.gov/aesop/025.html). 

I've spent a lifetime recovering from my early childhood diabetes diagnosis by building an organic protocol of cycling, feasting, fasting, meditating, running, and resting.

*Diabetes diagnosis is a lesson in disguise,  
Repeated trauma from diagnosis to demise,  
Diabetes is an education by improvisation,  
A data dissertation sans orchestration.*

<img class="icon-headshot" src="/images/tama.jpg" alt="Drums" title="Drums"></img>

For me, drums made jazz approachable until my mind, body, and soul coalesced. I'm still learning. Classics have their place, but 
live trio fusion is where I find peace. 

I planned to be a classical musician, but I gave up my music scholarship to study computer
science. I believed that vocation beat avocation until I realized that gig money paid the mortgage too. I spent years gigging and I still like to riff for fun so my time learning music was well-spent.

The [beauty of jazz](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/jazz-is-freedom-grimstad) as an art form is that it depends on the artist, the listener, and the artist-listener. Jazz is the greatest triumph of listening as art. 
Take a bassist like Ron Carter, a drummer like Bryan Blade, a guitarist like Pat Metheny, and a pianist like Marcin Wasilewski, then listen carefully to their transcendent sound.

Software started as a *personal* science for me - peeking and poking at *personal* computers.

Decades later, I'd realize that [Xerox PARC's formative years](https://spectrum.ieee.org/xerox-parc) 
fortuitously coincided with  my early childhood education.
Five years later, we breathed software
from Apple to Atari and beyond. No surprise, then, that our school resembled a mix of 
[Alan Kay's employers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alan_Kay#Subsequent_work) and 
[Bill Gates schooling](/people/bill_gates_at_lakeside.html). 

From graduating high school to graduating college, the fortuitous timing of innovation continued with my favorite database, operating system, and programming language: 

 * [Michael Stonebraker](https://amturing.acm.org/award_winners/stonebraker_1172121.cfm) released Postgres
 * Guido van Rossum released Python 
 * Linus Torvalds released Linux

In a decade, open source software (OSS) established itself as a viable alternative. 
The cultural transformation would take another decade. Nothing has influenced my work more than using Linux, Postgres, and Python.

> It is software that gives form and purpose to
a programmable machine, much as a sculptor shapes clay. Leonardo called music
*shaping the invisible*, and his phrase is even more apt as a description of
software. <footer>- <cite>[Alan Kay][3]</cite></footer>
