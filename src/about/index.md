##### About

I'm into <a href="#health">health</a>, <a href="#music">music</a>, and <a href="#software">software</a>.

My compulsion with health is simple. My diagnosis with Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus at age 7 imparted a certain premature-maturity on me. 

I responded as best I could by studying biology and  chemistry in elementary school. 

As a teenager, I was invited and joined the board of directors of my local American Diabetes Association chapter.

Healthcare is self-care, at least in the United States.

I've discovered that, from Shorthairs to Weimaraners to Vizslas, pointers have a way of moving me. Like a nomad, I'm always on the run. From what, I'm not exactly sure. The rolling stone gathers no moss.

But before I was on the run, my teenage adulation of [Breaking Away](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/arts/breaking-away-was-this-actors-breakout-role-
fans-say-it-changed-their-lives-too) ended with a spectacular bike
crash. Slow jogging long distances has taught me that [the race is not always to the swift](https://read.gov/aesop/025.html). 

I've spent a lifetime learning from my childhood diabetes diagnosis by building a protocol of feasting, fasting, and exercise.

**My life's purpose is to ameliorate diabetes for myself and others.** 

Why ameliorate? Well, consider the definition:

<dl>
<dt>ameliorate</dt>
<dd>make something bad better or more tolerable</dd>
</dl>

Of course, I can't actually cure diabetes, but the [path](https://dornsife.usc.edu/news/stories/a-diet-that-mimics-fasting-may-reverse-type-1-and-type-2-diabetes/#:~:text=Longo%20and%20his%20team%20also,could%20alleviate%20diabetes%20in%20humans.) to [remission](https://www.valterlongo.com/diabetes-obesity/) is [clear](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357144/) and the milestones are [clearer](https://www.bbc.com/news/health-39070183) yet. Many of those milestones emerged recently:

* 2019
    * Adopted a whole-foods, plant-based (WFPB) diet 
        * Lost ~23 Kg in the process 
* 2021
    * Finished the Belmar Bridge half marathon 
        * Medaled in my age group
    * HbA1c reached 6.0, below the threshold of T1D diagnosis
* 2022
    * Finished the Pittsburgh Marathon
      * Near slowest marathon times recorded
        * First half matched my half-marathon (2:10)
        * Second half took **4 hours**
    * Rain reminded me of winter 98-99 in Seattle (El Niño)
* 2023
    * Shut off my insulin pump for the first time in over two decades
    * I shed a tear when the cyborg shadow I'd been haunted by vanished
    * Started work on my book about my unique approach to diabetes
* 2024
    * Completed the South Park half marathon
    * Completed the Rabid Raccoon half marathon

For me, drums made jazz approachable when I was too young and didn't possess the fine motor control skills to master the feel (exteroception). I'm still learning. 

Live, acoustic, trio fusion is where I find peace. Some call it [third stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_stream) which curiously pre-dates *fusion*. 

I planned to be a classical musician, but I gave up my music scholarship when I dropped out of music school to study computer
science instead. My parents said that *The Corporation* would pay the rent until I realized that my gig money paid the mortgage. I spent years gigging so my time learning music was well-spent.

The [beauty of jazz](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/jazz-is-freedom-grimstad) as an art form is that it depends on the artist, the listener, and the artist-listener. Jazz is the greatest triumph of listening as art. 
Take a bassist like Ron Carter, a drummer like Bryan Blade, a guitarist like Pat Metheny, and a pianist like Marcin Wasilewski, then listen carefully to their transcendent sound.

Software started as a *personal* science for me as an adolescent - peeking and poking at *personal* computers. 

Decades later I practice software as experiments in art and intuitive philosophy, like my <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/">heroes</a>. 

I've been fortunate to work across the entire spectrum of software from microcomputing to macrocomputing. 

My work has spanned:

* [APIs](https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf) and  [Automation](https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/product-portfolio/automation-point)
* [Cancer](http://www.nomos.com/pdf/BN_MB_Corvus_MSF0003_R1_06142016.pdf) and [Diabetes](https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps#:~:text=they%20craft%20glucose%20meters%20for%20diabetics) 
* [Design](https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps) and [Startups](/cobind_retrospective.html) 

But nothing has influenced my work more than open source's 3 P's: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment">ProxMox</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Python</a>.

a programmable machine, much as a sculptor shapes clay. Leonardo called music
*shaping the invisible*, and his phrase is even more apt as a description of
software. <footer>- <cite>[Alan Kay][3]</cite></footer>

What code and jazz share beyond four-letter-words is that both result from ephemeral, liminal, modal consciousness and context beyond language. Indeed, in terms of language, one is compulsively logical while the other is impulsively emotional.
