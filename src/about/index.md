For me, drums made jazz approachable when I was too young and didn't possess the fine motor control skills to master the feel (exteroception). I'm still learning. 

Live, acoustic, trio fusion is where I find peace. Some call it [third stream](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Third_stream) which curiously pre-dates *fusion*. 

I planned to be a classical musician, but I gave up my music scholarship when I dropped out of music school to study computer
science instead. My parents said that *The Corporation* would pay the rent until I realized that my gig money paid the mortgage. I spent years gigging so my time learning music was well-spent.

The [beauty of jazz](https://thebaffler.com/salvos/jazz-is-freedom-grimstad) as an art form is that it depends on the artist, the listener, and the artist-listener. Jazz is the greatest triumph of listening as art. 
Take a bassist like Ron Carter, a drummer like Bryan Blade, a guitarist like Pat Metheny, and a pianist like Marcin Wasilewski, then listen carefully to their transcendent sound.

Software started as a *personal* science for me as an adolescent - peeking and poking at *personal* computers. 

Decades later I practice software as experiments in art and intuitive philosophy, like my <a href="https://www.quantamagazine.org/computer-scientist-donald-knuth-cant-stop-telling-stories-20200416/">heroes</a>. 

I've been fortunate to work across the entire spectrum of software from microcomputing to macrocomputing. 

My work has spanned:

* [APIs](https://xmlrpc.sourceforge.net/documentation.pdf) and  [Automation](https://www.broadcom.com/products/mainframe/product-portfolio/automation-point)
* [Cancer](http://www.nomos.com/pdf/BN_MB_Corvus_MSF0003_R1_06142016.pdf) and [Diabetes](https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps#:~:text=they%20craft%20glucose%20meters%20for%20diabetics) 
* [Design](https://www.fastcompany.com/1279088/inside-maya-designs-innovation-boot-camps) and [Startups](/cobind_retrospective.html) 

But nothing has influenced my work more than open source's 3 P's: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Stonebraker">Postgres</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxmox_Virtual_Environment">ProxMox</a>, and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guido_van_Rossum">Python</a>.

> It is software that gives form and purpose to
a programmable machine, much as a sculptor shapes clay. Leonardo called music
*shaping the invisible*, and his phrase is even more apt as a description of
software. <footer>- <cite>[Alan Kay][3]</cite></footer>

What code and jazz share beyond four-letter-words is that both result from ephemeral, liminal, modal consciousness and context beyond language. Indeed, in terms of language, one is compulsively logical while the other is impulsively emotional.
