##### Peter Pirolli on Human-Computer Sensemaking Models

###### The Challenges of Incorporating AI

> * Models of human cognition in sensemaking have informed the design
and engineering of higher-performance systems
* For the foreseeable future, AI components in complex sensemaking
tasks will not be autonomous—they will work interdependently with
human specialists
* Mixed human-AI systems “teams” pose new challenges and require
new designs
* My bet is that those designs can be informed by new cognitive
science research focused specifically on human-AI interaction in
sensemaking tasks
