Don K. I'm lucky I was surrounded by Europeans after Boston: "We don't know where you're from but you're not from here!".  Chortle.


That made me feel like Alien Intelligence.


Math and music may be the only universal languages on earth. 


But it's only in seeing that our need for a Quadrivium 2.0 is found in the realization that the Greeks could see that Math and Music were connected, but their vision was limited, transient, and required revision over time. I don't know history well enough to know where the quadrivium evolved in millennia.


What the world needs now though beyond Don Norman's books and insights, is for tech to enter the Quadrivium between space, time, space-time, and beyond beyond where information models left the mind behind, leaving most humans wondering what happened as the sheer volume and velocity washed over them like a flood.


Learning lies in liminal language.
