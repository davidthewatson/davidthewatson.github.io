### Proxmox Virtualization Environment

[Proxmox Virtual Environment](https://pve.proxmox.com/wiki/Main_Page) was invented by [Dietmar Maurer and Martin Maurer in 2008](https://www.proxmox.com/en/about/company). They are two Linux developers who founded Proxmox Server Solutions GmbH, the company behind Proxmox VE.

Dietmar and Martin Maurer were motivated to create Proxmox VE because they found that OpenVZ, a popular container virtualization technology at the time, lacked a backup tool and a management GUI. They also saw the potential of KVM, a full virtualization technology that was gaining popularity, and wanted to combine the two technologies into a single platform.

The first public release of Proxmox VE took place in April 2008. It was an instant success, and has since become one of the most popular open source virtualization platforms available.

Proxmox VE is now used by over 73,000 server hosts worldwide, and is supported by a large and active community of developers and users. Dietmar and Martin Maurer continue to be involved in the development of Proxmox VE, and are committed to making it the best virtualization platform possible.
