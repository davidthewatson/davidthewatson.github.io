### The Five Stages of SRE

> I am a rebel in a world that made development vs. operations the status quo. I am an SRE leader with LinkedIn, and Iâ€™d like to share with you my observations and experiences building and making Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) teams successful there. In particular, I want to share a few key observations on the evolutionary path of SRE, how that path is influenced by the relationship with the software engineer (SWE), and how the allocation of roles and responsibilities changes with time.
