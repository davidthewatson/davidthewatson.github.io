### Kenneth Jon Watson 

#### In memoriam

Kenneth Jon Watson, of North Sewickley, PA  died peacefully at Lakeview nursing home in Darlington, PA on January 7, 2024.

Born February 19, 1941 in New Brighton, PA, Ken grew up in Fallston, and graduated from New Brighton High School in 1960. Ken was also known as “Doc” among his friends.

Ken was preceded in death by his parents, Clarence and Kathleen Watson, and his brother, James.

Ken is survived by his brother, Robert; his sisters, Marianne and Nancy; and his son, David along with numerous nieces and nephews.

As an adult, Ken was a long-time member of three organizations:

* Fallston Fire Department

* New Brighton Sewer Authority 

* Rev Masters Car Club

His affinity for security and service found a welcome home near his childhood home where he'd share duties with his brothers, their father, other fire-fighters, and their community. 

His commitment to keeping the community clean and safe was at-home in the sewage plant he oversaw for 3 decades.

His love of cars found kinship among close friends in Rev Masters.

In retirement, Ken continued his professional work consulting with several local treatment plants. He enjoyed bicycling local trails with friends and family when he wasn’t visiting drag races or car shows.

The family would like to thank everyone at BCTA, DCI, and Lakeview who cared for him as his health declined, along with numerous friends and family who gave selflessly when he needed it most.

In lieu of a service, a memorial celebration of photographs and memories will be scheduled later this year in warmer weather.
